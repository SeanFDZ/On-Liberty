  "content": "<p>Lincoln spoke only 272 words, but they were designed for moments <em>exactly like this one</em> - moments when the nation feels uneasy, institutions look compromised, and public trust strains under the weight of scandal and cynicism.</p>\n\n<p>A few specific threads resonate powerfully with the events of this week:</p>\n\n<p><strong>“A government of the people, by the people, for the people…”</strong></p>\n\n<p>When scandals erupt, whether revelations in the Epstein files, or American officials bending their posture to foreign autocrats, the question isn’t just “who did what.”</p>\n\n<p>It’s: <strong>Who is the government serving?</strong> If leaders appear captured, compromised, or deferential to private power or foreign interests, it violates Lincoln’s central premise: the government belongs to the citizenry, not to billionaires, foreign monarchies, or political elites.</p>\n\n<p>The Gettysburg Address is a reminder that <strong>legitimacy flows upward from the people</strong>, not downward from the powerful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“We cannot dedicate… we cannot consecrate… we cannot hallow this ground.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lincoln’s point was humility:  no speech, no ceremony, no performance can sanctify something that is fundamentally unjust.</p>\n\n<p>Applied to today: No press conference, no diplomatic handshake, no carefully staged bow can cleanse actions that offend democratic values or appear to trade dignity for favor.  If something is wrong in substance, no presentation can make it right.</p>\n\n<p>When Americans see public officials behaving obsequiously toward foreign powers, especially those tied to repression, human rights abuses, or malign influence, it violates that same sense of civic self-respect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“The great task remaining before us…”</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lincoln was speaking in the middle of national crisis, without the benefit of hindsight.  He didn’t pretend things were fine. He emphasized responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>This week’s events, especially the Epstein files exposing networks of elite corruption, highlight our own “great task”: \t•\t<strong>to demand accountability, not excuses</strong> \t•\t<strong>to insist that justice is blind, even to wealth and influence</strong> \t•\t<strong>to resist the normalization of conduct that undermines republican virtue</strong> \t•\t<strong>to safeguard institutions that depend on public trust</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lincoln’s words acknowledge that democracy survives only if citizens continually recommit to it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“That this nation… shall have a new birth of freedom.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the most hopeful line. Even in the midst of war, Lincoln believed the Republic could renew itself, not through nostalgia, but through courage.</p>\n\n<p>Today, that renewal requires confronting uncomfortable truths: elite misconduct, foreign influence, democratic backsliding, the erosion of norms, and the steady tolerance of behavior we once would have found unthinkable.</p>\n\n<p>A “new birth of freedom” starts with refusing to shrug off corruption simply because it comes from people aligned with one’s tribe.</p>\n\n<p><em>Lincoln reminded us that a republic survives only when free people hold their leaders, and themselves, to higher standards than convenience or loyalty.  The events of this week, from the Epstein disclosures to public displays of deference before foreign monarchs, force us to ask whether our institutions still serve the people or the powerful.  The Gettysburg Address is a call to recover moral seriousness, to recommit to government by the people, and to ensure that this nation does not drift into the hands of those who would gladly trade dignity for influence.  The great task remains before us - and it belongs to all of us.</em></p>",
