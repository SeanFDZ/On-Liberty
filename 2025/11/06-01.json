  "content": "<p>n the mid-90s, as a cadet, I saw a sign at the base commissary: “We Accept Food Stamps.”  That’s when I realized some of our own troops and their families struggled to put food on the table.\r\n\r\nYears later, in Afghanistan, we ate from boxes stamped “For consumption by military personnel and prisoners only.”  Even in war, the Geneva Conventions and U.S. law required us to feed prisoners, because every human being deserves to eat.\r\n\r\nThat’s not politics.  That’s principle.  The first duty of a free society is to refuse to accept preventable suffering as normal.\r\n\r\nWhen we debate conditioning SNAP benefits on political compliance, we forget what I learned in uniform:  A nation that feeds prisoners of war should never turn its back on its own hungry.  When government makes hunger a tool of leverage, it risks losing more than a policy fight, it risks losing its soul.\r\n\r\nIt should be completely unacceptable to withhold SNAP payments because of a difference in political belief.  If we can feed prisoners of war, we should never turn our back on our hungry neighbors.</p>",
