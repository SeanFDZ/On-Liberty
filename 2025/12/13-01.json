I’ve spent more than 30 years studying U.S. National Security Strategy, including four years serving as a presidential nuclear strike advisor. I’ve lived inside the systems designed to prevent catastrophe and preserve deterrence. I know the difference between strength and noise.</p>\n\n<p>And what I am watching now is not strength.</p>\n\n<p>It is the quiet dismantling of the framework that made the United States powerful for seventy years, while we convince ourselves this is victory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The clearest signal: our allies are hedging</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you want the least partisan, most concrete evidence that something has gone wrong, look at what our allies are doing, not what they’re saying.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, the United States didn’t just supply weapons.  <strong>We set the standard:</strong> \t•\tAircraft \t•\tCommunications \t•\tMunitions \t•\tLogistics \t•\tCommand and control</p>\n\n<p>Allies built their forces around ours because it was rational.  Interoperability gave us leverage, leadership, and cohesion.  Coalition warfare worked because everyone was plugged into the same ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>That is changing.</p>\n\n<p>Quietly, methodically, our allies are: \t•\tBuilding indigenous weapons systems \t•\tProcuring from each other instead of the U.S. \t•\tDesigning supply chains that bypass U.S. export controls \t•\tReducing reliance on U.S. wartime sustainment</p>\n\n<p>This is not rebellion.  <em>It is insurance.</em></p>\n\n<p>From their perspective, dependence on a politically volatile supplier is strategic malpractice.  When support can be paused, conditioned, or reversed unpredictably, allies hedge.  That behavior is observable.  It is measurable.  And once it hardens into structure, it is extraordinarily difficult to reverse.</p>\n\n<p>We are surrendering leverage we built over generations, without firing a shot.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What framework is being dismantled</strong></p>\n\n<p>For most of the post-1950 era, U.S. power rested on a simple, resilient framework: \t•\t<strong>Alliance leadership</strong>, not transactional partnerships \t•\t<strong>Institutional continuity</strong>, not personality-driven policy \t•\t<strong>Economic integration with allies</strong>, not isolation from them \t•\t<strong>Democratic legitimacy</strong> at home as a strategic asset \t•\t<strong>Predictability</strong>, even amid disagreement</p>\n\n<p>This framework outlasted presidents, wars, and crises.  It is why deterrence held during the Cold War and why the United States could project power far beyond raw military strength.</p>\n\n<p>We didn’t always live up to it, but allies believed we aspired to it.</p>\n\n<p>That belief mattered.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this moment different from past cycles of political turbulence is that this shift is no longer informal.  For the first time since the early Cold War, the United States has issued a National Security Strategy that explicitly breaks with the post-1950 consensus, treating alliances as transactional, elevating sovereignty over institutions, downplaying democracy, and recasting predictability as weakness rather than strength.</p>\n\n<p>Every administration since 1950, Republican and Democrat alike, argued over tactics but preserved the same strategic foundation.  This one discards it.  That matters, because allies plan around doctrine, not personalities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How adversaries “win” without firing a shot</strong></p>\n\n<p>Modern competition no longer centers on tanks and missiles alone.  It targets <em>trust, cohesion, and decision-making.</em></p>\n\n<p>Adversaries don’t need to control leaders or issue orders.  They only need to <em>exploit incentives</em>, to amplify division, reward outrage, erode institutional trust, and turn cooperation into suspicion.</p>\n\n<p>Social media made this scalable.  Not by inventing beliefs, but by intensifying existing fractures and feeding back the most destabilizing narratives.</p>\n\n<p>The result isn’t collapse.  It’s corrosion.</p>\n\n<p>Alliances fray.  Institutions weaken.  Predictability disappears.  And our adversaries benefit without ever crossing a red line.</p>\n\n<p>No puppet strings required.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The economic and democratic cost</strong></p>\n\n<p>National power is cumulative.  It depends on long-term investment, stable rules, and trusted partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>When economic policy becomes volatile and punitive toward allies: \t•\tCosts rise \t•\tRetaliation follows \t•\tSupply chains fragment \t•\tInnovation slows</p>\n\n<p>You cannot tariff your way to dominance. You cannot coerce allies into prosperity. And you cannot hollow out institutions without weakening the state.</p>\n\n<p>Equally dangerous is the reframing of internal political conflict as a national security threat.  History is very clear here: systems that treat dissent and pluralism as vulnerabilities become brittle.  Brittle systems don’t bend, they shatter.</p>\n\n<p>Democratic legitimacy is not a moral luxury.</p>\n\n<p>It is a strategic asset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why this feels familiar to Cold War kids</strong></p>\n\n<p>Those of us who grew up under nuclear deterrence learned something early:</p>\n\n<p>The most dangerous moments aren’t when enemies are loud, but when the systems meant to prevent catastrophe quietly decay.</p>\n\n<p>We built safeguards because we understood human judgment is fallible.  We trusted institutions more than personalities.  We valued predictability over bravado.</p>\n\n<p>What alarms me now is the <em>systemic abandonment of those safeguards</em>, and the insistence that this represents strength.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final thought</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a military kid, I learned that deterrence is about credibility. As a strategist, I learned credibility is cumulative and fragile. As a nuclear advisor, I learned systems fail long before they collapse.</p>\n\n<p>We are not defeated.</p>\n\n<p>But we are doing something far more dangerous:</p>\n\n<p><em>We are dismantling the framework that made us strong, and convincing ourselves this is victory.</em></p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength. That is no longer our strategy.</p>",
