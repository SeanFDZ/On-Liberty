  "content": "<blockquote><p>“Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.”</p><cite>— Thomas Paine, <em>Common Sense</em>, 1776</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>We are often told that “universal healthcare” is an alien idea, something foreign to American practice, too complex, too costly, or incompatible with our traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Yet this claim collapses on inspection.  The United States already operates taxpayer-funded healthcare systems that guarantee access for selected groups.  We do not debate whether such systems can function.  We debate only who is entitled to certainty, and who must navigate illness as a financial risk.</p>\n\n<p>The result is not freedom of choice, but a rationing of security.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The coming shock: 300,000 Oklahomans in the balance</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Oklahoma alone, roughly 300,000 people rely on Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage made affordable by enhanced premium tax credits.  These credits are not marginal.  They apply to about 94 percent of Marketplace enrollees in the state.  If they expire at the end of 2025, as current law dictates, premiums for many households will more than double.</p>\n\n<p>This population sits squarely in the gap between poverty and comfort:  too “well off” for Medicaid, too exposed to absorb full insurance prices.  For rural families, where incomes are lower and employer-sponsored coverage is less common, the increase is not theoretical.  Reporting by Oklahoma policy analysts shows that in some rural counties, premiums could rise by hundreds to nearly a thousand dollars per month.</p>\n\n<p>When insurance becomes unaffordable, people do not become healthier.  They delay care, skip medications, and eventually present for treatment when conditions are more severe and more expensive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why ACA coverage is different from “the open market”</strong></p>\n\n<p>The ACA Marketplace is not merely a purchasing portal.  It is a regulatory structure that prevents the insurance market from doing what it historically did with ruthless efficiency: <em>exclude risk</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Marketplace plans must cover preexisting conditions.  They must include essential health benefits.  They must cap out-of-pocket costs. These requirements are not luxuries.  They are what make insurance function as insurance rather than as a gamble.</p>\n\n<p>When premiums rise sharply, people do not smoothly “shop around.”  Many fall out of coverage entirely.  Others migrate toward thinner, less protective plans that fail precisely when serious illness strikes.  The erosion of affordability does not create choice; it narrows it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rural hospitals: where policy abstractions become closures</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nowhere are the downstream effects clearer than in rural hospitals.</p>\n\n<p>When insured patients disappear, hospitals do not, at least initially.  Emergency rooms remain open.  Ambulances still arrive.  Care is still delivered.  What changes is who pays.</p>\n\n<p>National analyses estimate that if enhanced ACA credits expire, rural hospital revenues would decline by roughly $1.6 billion, while uncompensated care rises significantly.  For facilities already operating on thin or negative margins, this is not a paper loss.  It is the difference between keeping obstetrics open, maintaining overnight staffing, or shutting doors entirely.</p>\n\n<p>In Oklahoma, this risk concentrates geographically.  Western Oklahoma and the Panhandle rely on a small number of hospitals that serve vast catchment areas.  When coverage erodes, these hospitals become the financial shock absorbers for policy decisions made elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>This is not speculative.  Oklahoma has already experienced rural hospital closures and near-closures.  When coverage contracts, the pressure does not disperse evenly.  It accumulates at the margins, in places where there is no alternative facility an hour down the road.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The question we avoid</strong></p>\n\n<p>If we can already guarantee healthcare to some Americans through public systems, then the argument is no longer about feasibility.  It is about design and intent.</p>\n\n<p>We tolerate a system in which households quietly pay premiums, deductibles, co-pays, and surprise bills, while hospitals absorb losses when those households fall out of coverage.  We accept these costs because they are fragmented, opaque, and individualized.</p>\n\n<p>But opacity is not efficiency.  It is simply harder to see.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would universal healthcare cost more or less?</strong></p>\n\n<p>On this point, the evidence is unusually clear.</p>\n\n<p><em>As a nation, we would almost certainly spend less.</em></p>\n\n<p>The United States already spends far more per person on healthcare than any other advanced country, yet achieves worse outcomes on many measures.  The reason is not utilization.  It is structure.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s system layers costs at every stage: private insurers with administrative overhead and profit margins, employer-sponsored plans with duplicated billing systems, individual premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance, extensive eligibility verification and claims adjudication, and hospitals employing large billing departments to chase payment.</p>\n\n<p>Universal healthcare systems reduce or eliminate many of these costs simultaneously.  Countries with single-payer or near-universal systems spend less per capita while covering everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, this does not mean individuals pay nothing.  It means costs shift from fragmented private payments to predictable public financing, primarily through taxes, replacing premiums rather than adding to them.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple U.S. studies over decades, across political administrations, have reached the same conclusion:  <em>total national healthcare spending would decrease</em>, even if government spending increases, because households and employers would pay less overall.</p>\n\n<p>In short: government outlays go up, household and employer costs go down, total spending goes down.</p>\n\n<p>Cutting out insurance intermediaries does not eliminate all costs, but it removes one of the most expensive and least productive layers in the system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The real choice</strong></p>\n\n<p>The debate over healthcare in America is often framed as a contest between freedom and bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<p>That framing is false.</p>\n\n<p>The real choice is between a system that prices people out quietly, and one that covers everyone openly.  Between a system that pushes costs downstream to families and rural hospitals, and one that acknowledges healthcare as shared infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>We already pay for healthcare.  The question is whether we want to keep paying more, inefficiently, and unpredictably, or less, transparently, and collectively.</p>\n\n<p>A republic that can organize armies, build highways, and insure its elders can also ensure that illness does not determine who is allowed to remain solvent, or alive.</p>",
