  "content": "<p>When a government no longer feels itself bound by the law in the open light of day, the question before the people is no longer who among the accused is guilty, but <em>whether the Republic yet endures</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The architects of free government did not mistake this danger.  They understood that liberty does not perish first by violence, but by <em>exception</em>.  As Algernon Sidney warned a century earlier:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"The liberty of a people is not secured by the mere form of a constitution, but by the strict observance of its principles.\"</blockquote>\n\n<p>A constitution neglected in practice is a parchment shield.</p>\n\n<p>Law is not an indulgence granted by our leader, nor a courtesy extended at their pleasure.  It is the restraint placed upon power itself.  Its authority lies not in ceremony or assurance, but in <em>compliance</em>, most especially by those who would most benefit from its evasion.  When statutes are treated as negotiable, deadlines as optional, and transparency as a discretionary act, republican government does not merely weaken; it begins to fail.</p>\n\n<p>Here, the law spoke plainly.  It did not suggest disclosure, it <em>commanded</em> it.  It did not invite selective redaction, it <em>forbade</em> it.  It did not permit silent withholding, it <em>required</em> written justification submitted to the people's representatives.  These obligations were not buried in obscure clauses.  They were set forth in clear text, intelligible to any citizen willing to read.</p>\n\n<p>Yet what followed was not obedience, but maneuver.  Required materials were withheld.  Information previously released in full view was later obscured.  Redactions appeared where the statute expressly prohibited them.  Entire files were rendered unreadable without the explanations the law itself demands.  Material entered the public record only to be withdrawn once its implications became <em>inconvenient</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is not confusion.  It is choice.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Founders feared such choices more than the crimes of individual men.  As James Madison cautioned:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"Power is of an encroaching nature, and it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.\"</blockquote>\n\n<p>When the executive branch assumes the authority to decide which laws bind it and which do not, restraint has already failed.</p>\n\n<p>At such moments, the innocence or guilt of particular persons recedes in importance.  A Republic may survive corrupt actors; it cannot survive a system that protects itself from accountability.  Power released from legal constraint requires no depravity to become dangerous.  Precedent alone will carry it forward.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <em>open defiance</em> is more corrosive than secret abuse.  When law is disregarded openly, when commands are evaded in daylight, when prohibitions are ignored without embarrassment, when explanations collapse under the slightest scrutiny, authority declares that it no longer fears exposure.  And when power no longer fears exposure, law ceases to govern and remains only as ornament.</p>\n\n<p>This is the peculiar danger of lawlessness practiced in the open.  It distracts the public with disputes over character while the structure itself gives way.  It invites endless argument over motives and personalities, while the central question goes unasked: <em>if those entrusted with power may disregard the law at will, by what consent are they governed?</em></p>\n\n<p>As John Adams observed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"A government of laws, and not of men,\" is not merely a slogan but a condition.</blockquote>\n\n<p>When the law binds only some, it governs none.</p>\n\n<p>A free Republic does not depend upon faith in the virtue of rulers.  It depends upon <em>enforceable limits</em>.  When those limits are violated without remedy, when the law commands and power responds with silence or ink, the danger is not that justice may be delayed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is that justice has been set aside.</strong></p>",
