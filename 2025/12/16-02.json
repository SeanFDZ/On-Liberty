  "content": "<p>The Boston Tea Party is often reduced to a costume drama: men in disguise, crates in the harbor, a symbolic act of rebellion that looks tidy in hindsight.</p>\n\n<p>But the men who boarded those ships were not protesting a beverage.  They were protesting power exercised without accountability.</p>\n\n<p>They were protesting a system where: \t•\tDecisions were made far away \t•\tAuthority arrived unannounced \t•\tEnforcement came before explanation \t•\tAnd ordinary people were told their rights existed only on paper</p>\n\n<p>The issue was not taxation alone.  It was the presumption that the state could act first and justify itself later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Masks, Unmarked Authority, and Fear</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the most striking details of the Boston Tea Party is disguise.</p>\n\n<p>The colonists masked themselves not for theater, but for self-protection, because they understood that challenging unchecked power carried consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the masks are worn by the state.</p>\n\n<p>Unmarked vehicles. Hidden names. Obscured badges. Weapons drawn before words spoken.</p>\n\n<p>When authority refuses to identify itself, it is no longer merely enforcing law, it is asserting dominance.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a border issue. That is not a partisan issue. That is an American issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“No One Is Going to Help You”</strong></p>\n\n<p>What made 1773 dangerous was not violence, remarkably little of it occurred.  What made it revolutionary was the collapse of trust.</p>\n\n<p>The colonists had learned that appeals to law, reason, and citizenship no longer restrained those in power.</p>\n\n<p>When people are told, explicitly or implicitly, “No one is going to help you,” the social contract is already broken.</p>\n\n<p>That sentence, whether spoken in a colonial port or an American street, is the sound of legitimacy failing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Boston Tea Party Was a Warning</strong></p>\n\n<p>It was a warning about what happens when: \t•\tAuthority is anonymous \t•\tAccountability disappears \t•\tCitizens are treated as suspects first \t•\tAnd force replaces explanation</p>\n\n<p>The men who dumped tea into Boston Harbor did not believe themselves radical.  They believed they were defending normalcy, the idea that power must justify itself to the people it governs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why December 16 Still Matters</strong></p>\n\n<p>The lesson of the Boston Tea Party is not that resistance is inevitable.  It is that unchecked power teaches people to stop trusting institutions.</p>\n\n<p>And when that trust is gone, symbolism turns into something much more dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s question is the same as it was in 1773:</p>\n\n<p>What happens when law enforcement becomes something people fear, rather than something they recognize?</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why December 16 still matters.</p>",
