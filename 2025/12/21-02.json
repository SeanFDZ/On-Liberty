We are told that documents must be reviewed.   We are told that redactions are necessary.</p>\n\n<p>But we have seen what has been redacted, and more importantly, who has been spared by the ink.</p>\n\n<p>The survivors of Jeffrey Epstein are not asking for vengeance.  They are asking for what the law already demands and what the administration itself promised: the full release of records related to one of the most extensive child-trafficking operations in modern American history.</p>\n\n<p>Congress passed a law compelling disclosure.  The President signed it.  The deadline passed.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to them.”</p><cite>— George Mason, <em>Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776)</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>What followed was not compliance, but defiance.</p>\n\n<p>Entire files were blacked out.  Foundational indictments were withheld.  Documents known to exist were delayed without lawful justification.  A photograph of the president with a young girl briefly made public along with 15 others, and then quietly erased from the Department of Justice website yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the behavior of a government seeking justice.   It is the behavior of a government protecting itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Of Power Shielding Itself With Ink</strong></p>\n\n<p>Redaction is a legitimate tool when it shields the innocent.   Here, it has been wielded to shield the powerful.</p>\n\n<p>Survivors have spoken plainly.  They have recognized the pattern because they have lived it before.  Institutions delay.  Authorities equivocate.  Evidence is buried until outrage fades and memory dulls.</p>\n\n<p>One survivor spoke a truth that should chill every citizen: the labor invested in redaction was not spent to protect victims, but to protect those who sit above consequence.</p>\n\n<p>That accusation has not been rebutted.  It has been confirmed by conduct.</p>\n\n<p>The Justice Department claims it needs more time.  This is false on its face.  The documents in question are decades old.  They were in government custody long before this law was passed.  The deadline was known.  The obligation was clear.</p>\n\n<p>Delay here is not necessity.   It is strategy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The State Knew, and the State Failed</strong></p>\n\n<p>Among the few documents allowed into daylight was a 1996 FBI complaint describing the theft and sale of sexually explicit photographs of underage girls.  The crime was classified correctly at the time: child pornography.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government had this information.   The abuse continued.</p>\n\n<p>Every page withheld must now be read in that light.  Every black bar raises the same question: how many crimes were enabled by silence, and how many names are being protected now?</p>\n\n<p>A republic cannot survive the revelation that its laws are enforced only against the weak.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“Power is of an encroaching nature, and it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.”</p><cite>— James Madison, <em>Federalist No. 48 (1788)</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Of Executive Secrecy and Broken Promises</strong></p>\n\n<p>The administration proclaims itself transparent while practicing secrecy so aggressive it would shame a monarchy.</p>\n\n<p>To release thousands of pages while concealing the most consequential ones is not openness.  It is theater.  It is an attempt to exhaust the public with volume while denying it substance.</p>\n\n<p>We are told to trust the process by the very actors who have violated it.</p>\n\n<p>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, demanded these files be released.  His administration failed to do so.  Evidence reportedly touching the executive himself appeared briefly and then vanished without explanation.</p>\n\n<p>No court ordered its removal.   No justification was offered.</p>\n\n<p>In a free republic, such conduct would provoke inquiry.  In this moment, it is met with shrugs and press statements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This Is Not a Question of Guilt, but of Law</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let it be said plainly: no person is convicted by public opinion.  Every accused person deserves a fair trial.  These principles are not negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>But the law commands disclosure, and the executive branch does not possess the authority to decide that the law no longer applies when it becomes inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>If evidence exists suggesting that powerful men participated in, enabled, or concealed the rape of children, that evidence must be released.  Not selectively.  Not eventually.  Not after memory fades.</p>\n\n<p>Now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When a Republic Chooses Silence</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“A body of men, holding themselves accountable to nobody, ought not to be trusted by anybody.”</p><cite>— Thomas Paine, <em>Common Sense (1776)</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>In the pamphlets of an earlier age, this moment would have been recognized instantly.</p>\n\n<p>A government that conceals crimes of the crown   A legislature whose laws are ignored   An executive that decides what truth the people may see</p>\n\n<p>These were not tolerated as mere mismanagement.  They were named for what they were: corruption incompatible with liberty.</p>\n\n<p>To hide the rape of children is not merely immoral.  It is disqualifying.</p>\n\n<p>A government that does this forfeits its claim to moral authority.  A people who accept it risk becoming subjects rather than citizens.</p>\n\n<p>History does not ask whether secrecy was convenient.  It asks whether justice was done.</p>\n\n<p>And on this matter, the record, redacted as it is, already speaks.</p>",
