  "content": "<p>When the executive branch of government begins to accumulate powers beyond those granted by the constitution, the citizens must take notice. For it is in the nature of power to expand, as water seeks the lowest ground, and those who possess authority will naturally seek more of it, unless checked by the vigilance of a free people.</p>\n\n<p>Let us examine the matter plainly, without the ornaments of courtly language that serve only to obscure truth from the common understanding. A government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed—this principle, once revolutionary, has become the foundation upon which all legitimate authority must rest.</p>\n\n<p>Yet we observe in our present circumstances a troubling pattern. The boundaries between the branches of government, so carefully drawn by our founders, grow ever more indistinct. The executive reaches into matters properly belonging to the legislature; the courts defer when they ought to check; and the people, distracted by the manifold concerns of daily life, take little notice until the chains are already forged.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.\" This maxim, attributed to various patriots, contains within it a profound truth that each generation must learn anew.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consider well the mechanisms by which free peoples have historically lost their liberties. It is seldom done by a single dramatic stroke—no tyrant announces his intentions plainly. Rather, it proceeds by degrees: an emergency power here, an expanded interpretation there, a precedent established in one case that becomes standard practice in the next.</p>\n\n<p>What then is the duty of the citizen who perceives these encroachments? First, to speak plainly of what is observed. Second, to remind fellow citizens of the principles upon which their government was founded. Third, to exercise with diligence those rights of petition, assembly, and suffrage that remain the ultimate check upon governmental excess.</p>\n\n<p>The cause of liberty is never finally won, nor permanently lost. Each generation must decide anew whether freedom is worth the price of attention, engagement, and occasional sacrifice that its preservation requires.</p>",
