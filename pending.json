      "content": "<p>The United States government is pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela. This action follows the seizure of two previous vessels carrying Venezuelan crude.</p>\n\n<p>No formal declaration of war exists. No letter of marque has been issued by Congress. No blockade has been proclaimed through diplomatic channels to neutral nations.</p>\n\n<p>Yet ships are being stopped on the high seas.</p>\n\n<p>I say this as someone who wore the uniform. The seizure of merchant vessels in international waters is an act that, throughout history, has preceded or constituted war. The British seizure of American sailors and cargo was among the causes that led to the War of 1812. Confederate commerce raiders targeting Union shipping were instruments of declared hostilities. When Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, it understood it was choosing war.</p>\n\n<p>These were not police actions. They were acts of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Sanctions Authority</p>\n\n<p>The current seizures operate under the authority of economic sanctions, primarily those imposed through executive orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. These sanctions prohibit transactions with certain Venezuelan entities and individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is straightforward: When did the interdiction of neutral shipping on the high seas become an administrative matter?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions have existed for decades. But the scope of what now happens under sanctions authorities would be unrecognizable to earlier generations. We have moved from prohibiting American companies from doing business with sanctioned entities to actively seizing vessels, often flagged to third countries, carrying goods between non-American parties.</p>\n\n<p>This expansion happened gradually. Each step was justified as necessary, proportionate, targeted. Each seizure was framed as enforcement, not escalation.</p>\n\n<p>But when enforcement requires stopping ships at sea, the question is no longer about financial compliance. It is about the projection of force beyond our borders and outside the framework that the Constitution establishes for such projections.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Understood</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power \"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\"</p>\n\n<p>Letters of marque and reprisal were the mechanism by which Congress authorized private vessels to seize enemy shipping. The Founders included this specific power because they understood that taking ships at sea was an act of such gravity it required legislative authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the President's authority as commander in chief \"would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces... while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies, all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature.\"</p>\n\n<p>The distinction was deliberate. The power to take ships, like the power to declare war, was too consequential to rest with one person.</p>\n\n<p>## The Quiet Expansion</p>\n\n<p>I served in government during a period when these authorities were expanding. The justification was always the same: We face threats that require flexibility. Traditional mechanisms are too slow. The Constitution contemplates executive action in emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>All of this contains truth. But it elides a more fundamental question.</p>\n\n<p>If the authority being exercised requires ships to be stopped, boarded, and seized, has it not crossed the threshold that the Constitution places under legislative control?</p>\n\n<p>The ships being pursued are not American-flagged. The oil being carried is not American property. The transactions being interdicted are between third parties. The legal theory is that because these transactions ultimately violate U.S. sanctions, any ship anywhere can be subject to American jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>This is not enforcement of American law within American territory. This is the assertion that American law applies extraterritorially to anyone, anywhere, whose actions we deem to violate our economic prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what we would say if another nation asserted the same authority.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela is not popular. Its government's human rights record is poor. Its economic policies have been disastrous. These facts are not in dispute.</p>\n\n<p>But constitutional principles do not depend on whether the target is sympathetic.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the United States government has the authority, through executive action alone, to interdict merchant shipping on the high seas outside any declared state of hostilities.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we have redefined what \"war powers\" means. We have decided that the seizure of vessels, historically an act of war, is now simply an administrative tool of foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then what is happening requires congressional authorization that does not currently exist.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question being avoided is this: What limits remain on executive power if the interdiction of international commerce can be conducted indefinitely, without legislative authorization, under the banner of sanctions enforcement?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions can be imposed by executive order. They can be maintained indefinitely. They can expand in scope from prohibiting American transactions to seizing third-party vessels. They require no declaration, no sunset provision, no periodic reauthorization.</p>\n\n<p>Compare this to the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces and limits such commitments to 60 days without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>The seizure of merchant vessels falls outside this framework entirely. It is treated as economic policy, not military action.</p>\n\n<p>Yet it requires warships. It involves the use of force. It is, in every practical sense, an act of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>I do not argue that sanctions are unconstitutional. I do not argue that the executive branch lacks any role in foreign affairs. I do not argue that Venezuela's government deserves support.</p>\n\n<p>I argue that the Constitution draws lines, and those lines matter.</p>\n\n<p>The power to seize ships was placed under legislative control because the Founders understood it as an act of war. That understanding has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to rename such acts so they fall outside constitutional constraints.</p>\n\n<p>When temporary measures become permanent, when extraordinary actions become routine, when the vocabulary changes but the substance remains, we are not adapting the Constitution to modern needs.</p>\n\n<p>We are evading it.</p>\n\n<p>The third tanker being pursued is not the story. The story is that we have accepted as normal what previous generations would have recognized as war, and we have done so without asking whether the constitutional architecture for such decisions still applies.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unasked, is why this matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to understand how things work when authorities want something done quickly. There are protocols. There are reviews. There are chains of command designed to ensure that even in moments of urgency, we remain a nation of laws.</p>\n\n<p>On March 15, 2025, those protocols failed.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act that evening to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order the same evening, halting the deportations until the men could have their day in court.</p>\n\n<p>The planes landed in El Salvador anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Let that fact settle. A federal judge issued an order. The executive branch ignored it. The government's defense was not that the order came too late, or that communications failed, or that some emergency made compliance impossible. The Justice Department argued that the judge had no authority to issue the order in the first place—that questions of foreign policy placed these deportations beyond judicial review.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a claim about timing. That is a claim about power.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Judge Found</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Judge Boasberg ruled that the United States government denied due process to 137 Venezuelan men it deported under the Alien Enemies Act. His opinion is careful, measured, grounded in constitutional requirement rather than political preference. The men, he found, deserved the chance to prove they were not gang members before being sent to a foreign prison. The government provided no such opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The administration will appeal. That is its right.</p>\n\n<p>But the opinion raises a question that transcends this particular case: If expedited removal allows the government to \"secretly spirit\" people to foreign custody before a court can intervene, what remains of judicial review?</p>\n\n<p>The answer the Justice Department offered in March was: nothing. When the executive acts in matters touching foreign relations, it suggested, courts should stay out.</p>\n\n<p>That position has a name. It is called unreviewable discretion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Act Itself</p>\n\n<p>The Alien Enemies Act dates to 1798. It authorizes the president, during declared war or invasion, to detain or deport nationals of hostile foreign powers. It has been used three times in our history: during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. Each time, it was invoked in the context of actual, declared war between nations.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela has not invaded the United States. Congress has not declared war. What exists instead is the government's assertion that Tren de Aragua constitutes an invasion, and that this assertion alone triggers authority under a statute designed for armed conflict between sovereign states.</p>\n\n<p>This is not originalism. This is not even creative interpretation. This is taking language written for one context and applying it to another because the language is broad enough to bear the weight.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Tren de Aragua is dangerous. Criminal organizations are dangerous. The question is whether danger alone converts police work into war, and whether calling something an invasion makes it one for constitutional purposes.</p>\n\n<p>If it does, there is no limiting principle. Any transnational criminal network becomes an invading force. Any executive can invoke wartime authority without asking Congress to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>## What Due Process Requires</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Amendment is nine words long in the relevant part: \"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not \"no citizen.\" No person.</p>\n\n<p>Due process does not mean the government cannot deport people. It means the government must provide some opportunity to contest the grounds for deportation before it acts. That opportunity can be brief. It can be limited. But it must exist.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg's ruling does not say the government was wrong to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. It does not say the men must be granted asylum, or released, or allowed to remain in the United States. It says only that they are entitled to a hearing—a chance to show that the government's factual basis for calling them gang members is mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>The administration argued that providing such hearings was impractical. The men had already been deported. They were in El Salvador, then Venezuela. Bringing them back would be costly and complicated.</p>\n\n<p>True enough.</p>\n\n<p>But the impracticality is the government's own creation. The men would still be in the United States, able to appear before an immigration judge, if the executive had not sent them to El Salvador hours after a federal court said not to.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot manufacture your own emergency and then cite the emergency as grounds for denying rights.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>This case will be remembered not for what happened to 137 Venezuelans, but for what it establishes about executive power in immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>If the government can deport people to foreign custody before a court order takes effect, and then argue that their deportation makes judicial review impractical, then every future administration has a roadmap. Act fast enough, move people far enough, and the courts cannot reach them.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a bug in the government's theory. It is the theory.</p>\n\n<p>The Justice Department did not apologize for defying Judge Boasberg's order. It argued that the order was invalid from the start—that courts have no role in reviewing deportations conducted under the Alien Enemies Act, or at least no role that can be exercised quickly enough to matter.</p>\n\n<p>If that argument prevails, the constitutional consequence is clear: There will be a category of executive action that is, for all practical purposes, unreviewable. Not because the law prohibits review, but because the government can complete the action before review occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Speed becomes immunity.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg also found probable cause to hold the administration in criminal contempt for violating his March order. The appellate court has paused that proceeding, but the question remains: What happens when the executive branch ignores a judicial order?</p>\n\n<p>In a system of separated powers, the answer cannot be \"nothing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Contempt is not a political weapon. It is the judiciary's tool for enforcing its own judgments. Without it, court orders become suggestions. The executive obeys when it agrees, defies when it does not, and suffers no consequence either way.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a constitutional republic operates. That is how power consolidates.</p>\n\n<p>The men in this case have since been returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange. Their immediate circumstances have changed. But the precedent remains. The next group of people subjected to expedited removal under the Alien Enemies Act, or any other authority the executive claims is beyond judicial reach, will face the same problem: by the time a court can rule, they will already be gone.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>This is not about immigration policy. Reasonable people can disagree about how many people should be admitted, under what conditions, and what should happen to those who enter unlawfully. Those are legitimate political questions.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether the executive branch must allow judicial review of its factual determinations before acting, or whether asserting urgency and foreign policy concerns exempts it from that requirement.</p>\n\n<p>If the latter, then we have redefined what \"due process\" means. It no longer means an opportunity to be heard before deprivation. It means an opportunity the government will provide if convenient, and decline if not.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a small change. It is a transformation of the relationship between the citizen—or the person, because the Constitution says person—and the state.</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist 47 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands\" is \"the very definition of tyranny.\" He was describing concentration within a single branch. But the same danger exists when one branch can act beyond the reach of the others—when it moves too fast for law to catch it, and then argues that speed itself makes accountability impossible.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that principle tested.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether Judge Boasberg's ruling will stand, or whether the government's theory will prevail: that in matters the executive declares urgent, involving people it declares dangerous, the constitutional requirement of due process dissolves into discretion.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in uniform. I understand operational necessity. I also understand the difference between a military operation conducted under legal authority and the seizure of assets that belongs in a different century entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The United States has deployed 15,000 troops to the Caribbean, ordered a naval blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers, seized at least two vessels, announced it will keep or sell both the ships and their cargo, and stated it is pursuing a third. The largest deployment to the region since the 1989 Panama invasion. The president has declared he will appropriate the property of a sovereign nation without compensation, without judicial process, without treaty authorization.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Venezuela's government. This is about what power claims it may do.</p>\n\n<p>## The Authority Question</p>\n\n<p>The stated justification is drug interdiction. Fentanyl, cocaine, organized crime. Legitimate national security concerns, all of them. But the constitutional framework for using military force abroad is narrow and specific. Congress declares war. The president may act in genuine emergencies under the War Powers Resolution. Treaty obligations create mutual defense commitments within defined boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is none of these things.</p>\n\n<p>A blockade is an act of war under international law. Seizing commercial vessels on the high seas and declaring you will sell their cargo is, as Venezuela's UN ambassador noted, difficult to distinguish from piracy. The United States does not recognize the Maduro government as legitimate. Fair enough. But non-recognition does not grant authority to appropriate property. If it did, we could seize the assets of every government we consider illegitimate. That is not law. That is might.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Ambassador to the UN offered this defense: \"Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claims to power and his narco-terrorist activities.\" Perhaps true. But the Constitution does not authorize the president to decide which foreign leaders are legitimate, seize their nations' resources, and redistribute them as he sees fit. That power, if it exists at all, would require congressional authorization. It would require a legal framework. It would require something other than a presidential announcement that we are taking ships and keeping what we find.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern That Should Concern Us</p>\n\n<p>This is the fourth such operation in recent months. More than 20 vessels targeted in the Pacific and Caribbean. At least 90 people killed in strikes the administration describes as counter-gang operations. Some legal experts suggest these actions may violate the laws of armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether drug trafficking is a serious problem. It is. The question is whether the seriousness of the problem justifies abandoning the legal constraints that distinguish a republic from an empire.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the mechanism. The president declares a threat. The president orders military action. The president seizes property. The president announces he will liquidate that property for U.S. benefit. Where in that sequence is congressional authorization? Where is judicial review? Where is the check on executive power that prevents \"national security\" from becoming a blank authorization for anything the president deems necessary?</p>\n\n<p>This is not hypothetical. I watched extraordinary authorities granted after September 11th become permanent features of government. Temporary surveillance powers that were never relinquished. Detention policies that started as emergency measures and became standard procedure. The slow migration from \"we must do this now\" to \"this is simply what we do.\"</p>\n\n<p>## What the Framers Understood</p>\n\n<p>The men who wrote the Constitution had recent experience with unchecked executive power. They had lived under a king who claimed the authority to seize property, wage war, and govern by decree. They designed a system specifically to prevent that concentration of power in one person.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison, Federalist 47: \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"</p>\n\n<p>We are watching the accumulation Madison warned against. Not through dramatic coup, but through the quiet assertion that the president may do what he judges necessary. That military force may be deployed, ships seized, and property liquidated based on executive determination alone. That the complexity of modern threats requires we trust the judgment of whoever holds the office.</p>\n\n<p>The Framers would not have trusted that judgment. They did not design a system that required trusting it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent</p>\n\n<p>Russia's UN ambassador called this \"a template for future acts of force against Latin American states.\" He is not wrong to worry. If the United States may seize the assets of any nation whose government we consider illegitimate, whose oil sales we believe fund activities we oppose, then we have announced a doctrine with no limiting principle.</p>\n\n<p>Today it is Venezuela and drug trafficking. Tomorrow it could be any nation, any resource, any stated justification. The legal architecture, once abandoned, is difficult to rebuild. The precedent, once set, becomes permission.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics drift toward something else. Not through sudden transformation, but through the steady expansion of what power claims it may do without asking permission.</p>\n\n<p>## What Should Be Asked</p>\n\n<p>Is there congressional authorization for this blockade?</p>\n\n<p>Under what legal framework does the president claim authority to seize foreign commercial vessels and appropriate their cargo?</p>\n\n<p>If this action is justified by Venezuela's status as a narco-state, what prevents the same reasoning from applying to any nation we accuse of facilitating drug trade?</p>\n\n<p>Who reviews these decisions? Who checks them?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is \"the president decides,\" then we have answered a different question than we intended.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>The argument will be made that this is different. That Venezuela is uniquely problematic, that Maduro is uniquely illegitimate, that the drug crisis is uniquely urgent. Perhaps. But constitutional principle does not operate on a curve graded by how much we dislike the target.</p>\n\n<p>Either we are a nation that operates under law, or we are a nation that operates under power. Either military force abroad requires legal authorization, or it requires only executive will. Either property seizures follow due process, or they follow presidential announcement.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot be both. And we are deciding, right now, which we will be.</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath did not include an asterisk for difficult cases. It did not include an exception for serious threats. It meant what it said: that the framework matters more than the outcome, that the process protects everyone, and that power exercised without legal constraint is not legitimate power regardless of its objective.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about defending Venezuela's government. This is about defending the system that prevents any government, including ours, from doing whatever it believes necessary.</p>\n\n<p>That system is being tested. The test is happening now.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The Department of Justice announced this week that it has discovered more than a million additional documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. They promise release \"in the coming days and weeks.\" The statement did not explain how these documents, which presumably existed during the initial review, were only now discovered.</p>\n\n<p>That's the detail that matters.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Epstein. The crimes are known. The victims are known. The dead cannot be brought to trial.</p>\n\n<p>This is about what a government owes its people when it says \"we have disclosed everything,\" and then months later says \"we have found a million more pages.\"</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in government service. I've reviewed classified materials under deadline pressure. I know what \"we're working around the clock\" means when spoken by lawyers protecting institutional interests rather than serving constitutional obligations.</p>\n\n<p>It means the clock started late.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We've Seen Before</p>\n\n<p>Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The law was specific: release all documents, redact only to protect victims and active investigations, do not redact to prevent embarrassment or reputational harm, and meet a deadline of December 19.</p>\n\n<p>The Department missed the deadline.</p>\n\n<p>The initial releases were heavily redacted, including names of possible co-conspirators whom the FBI had served with subpoenas in 2019. Lawmakers from both parties objected. The law clearly prohibited those redactions.</p>\n\n<p>Now we learn there are a million more documents that somehow weren't part of the initial inventory.</p>\n\n<p>The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required full disclosure by 2017. In 2017, agencies requested more time. They are still requesting more time. Documents from 1963 remain classified in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is this: Congress passes a transparency law. Agencies comply minimally. Years pass. The public's attention moves on. What was mandatory becomes negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>The law does not enforce itself.</p>\n\n<p>## What \"Review\" Means</p>\n\n<p>The Department says lawyers are \"working around the clock\" to review these newly discovered documents. This is presented as diligence. It is more accurately described as delay.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act is explicit about what may be redacted: victim identities and information that would compromise active criminal investigations. That's it. The law specifically states that embarrassment and reputational harm are not grounds for redaction.</p>\n\n<p>If the law means what it says, review should be straightforward. Find victim names, redact them. Check for overlap with ongoing prosecutions, redact those specific items. Release everything else.</p>\n\n<p>If review takes \"a few more weeks\" for a million documents, that's not document review. That's interest balancing. It's deciding which powerful people can be protected under a permissive interpretation of \"active investigation.\" It's determining how much the statute really means.</p>\n\n<p>This is how law stops being law and becomes suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>I've been part of classification reviews. When institutions want transparency, documents move quickly. When they don't, every page requires three meetings and a legal memo.</p>\n\n<p>Speed reveals intent.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Co-Conspirators</p>\n\n<p>Embedded in the already-released documents are FBI emails from 2019 mentioning ten possible co-conspirators. Six had been served with subpoenas. Three in Florida. One in Boston. One in New York. One in Connecticut.</p>\n\n<p>Their names are redacted.</p>\n\n<p>The law prohibits redaction to prevent embarrassment. Were these six people charged? If not, on what basis did the FBI decline prosecution? Those are the internal communications and memos the statute specifically requires.</p>\n\n<p>Epstein died in federal custody in 2019. Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2022. The investigation is not new. The FBI identified possible co-conspirators, served them with subpoenas, and made charging decisions years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Why are we still waiting to know who they were and why they weren't charged?</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a question about Jeffrey Epstein. It's a question about whether law applies differently to people with power and proximity to power.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we do not have equal justice. We have a system where connection determines consequence. And if that's the system, citizens deserve to know it plainly rather than discover it through redaction patterns and missed deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Requires</p>\n\n<p>Transparency is not a favor governments grant when convenient. It is a structural requirement of legitimate authority.</p>\n\n<p>When Congress passes a law requiring disclosure, that law represents the people's judgment that they are entitled to know what their government did and did not do. The executive branch does not have discretion to comply partially or slowly unless the law provides that discretion.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act provided limited discretion: protect victims and active investigations. Everything else must be released.</p>\n\n<p>If a million documents were somehow overlooked, that is not a reason for more time. It is evidence that the initial review was inadequate. The remedy is not another months-long review at the same pace. The remedy is to release everything not clearly covered by the two statutory exceptions, and let citizens see what their government has been doing.</p>\n\n<p>Trust is not rebuilt through promises of future transparency. It is rebuilt through present action.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>This case will clarify something important. Either the law means what it says, or it means what is convenient.</p>\n\n<p>If names are redacted because releasing them would be embarrassing, the law has been broken, and Congress should enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>If the \"review process\" continues indefinitely while public attention wanes, we will know that transparency laws are performative, not binding.</p>\n\n<p>If co-conspirators who were investigated but not charged remain unnamed because they are powerful or connected, we will know that equal justice is an aspiration rather than a practice.</p>\n\n<p>The facts are straightforward. The law is clear. What happens next will tell us whether clarity matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I've worked in government buildings named for people who served this country. You walk through those halls conscious of the names on the walls, the portraits in the lobbies, the dedications carved in stone. They aren't decorations. They're reminders of what the institution is supposed to serve.</p>\n\n<p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was created by federal law. Congress authorized it. Congress funded it. Congress named it after a president who had been assassinated in office. The statute establishing it, Public Law 88-260, enacted January 23, 1964, declares it \"a living memorial\" and \"the National Center for the Performing Arts.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not political preference. That's law.</p>\n\n<p>Now the sitting president has placed his own name on that memorial. A board he reconstituted voted unanimously to rename it. A congresswoman designated by statute as a board member says she was muted when she tried to object. The name went up on the building within hours.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about partisan alignment. This is about whether federal law governs federal property, or whether control of appointments means control of outcomes previously thought to be fixed by statute.</p>\n\n<p>## The Legal Question Nobody Is Answering</p>\n\n<p>Representative Beatty's lawsuit argues that renaming the Kennedy Center requires an act of Congress, not a board resolution. The White House says the board acted properly under its authority.</p>\n\n<p>That's a factual legal question with a factual legal answer.</p>\n\n<p>Either the authorizing statute allows the board to change the name of the institution, or it doesn't. Either Congress retains authority over the designation of federal memorials it creates, or control passes entirely to whoever holds appointment power over the board.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what we know: Public Law 88-260 names the institution. It doesn't delegate naming authority to the board. It establishes the center as a memorial to John F. Kennedy. The Supreme Court has long held that when Congress creates something by statute and specifies its essential characteristics, those characteristics cannot be altered except by Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The board has authority over operations, programming, fundraising. That's governance. Changing the name of a congressionally designated memorial is not governance. It's revision of the statute itself.</p>\n\n<p>If a board vote can rename a federal memorial established by law, then law is subordinate to appointment power. That's not a small shift. That's the difference between a government of laws and a government of loyalties.</p>\n\n<p>## How Boards Become Instruments</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after taking office, President Trump removed multiple Kennedy Center board members and replaced them with appointees. Thirty-four of fifty-seven members now serve at his appointment. His close adviser became board president. He became board chairman.</p>\n\n<p>That's within presidential authority. Appointment power is real power.</p>\n\n<p>But when appointment power converts a statutory board into a unanimous instrument, we're watching something beyond normal governance. When a congresswoman says she was silenced during a vote to alter what Congress created by law, we're watching process become performance.</p>\n\n<p>The White House statement justifies the name change by citing Trump's financial support for the center, his securing of congressional appropriations, his leadership of renovations. All of that may be true. None of it changes what statute requires.</p>\n\n<p>You don't earn the right to rename federal memorials by funding them. If that were the standard, every major donor could demand naming rights over national institutions. The Lincoln Memorial would be available for the highest bidder with enough friends in the right positions.</p>\n\n<p>This is why memorials are created by law, not by board resolution.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We're Watching</p>\n\n<p>This isn't the first time statutory constraints have dissolved under appointment power. It won't be the last.</p>\n\n<p>What's being normalized is the idea that control over an institution's board means control over the institution's identity, regardless of what the statute establishing it provides. That the person who appoints can become the thing appointed. That what Congress designates by law can be redesignated by voice vote if enough board seats change hands.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this pattern before, not in memorials but in regulatory agencies, in inspector general offices, in bodies designed to operate with some independence from the executive. First, the appointments change. Then the interpretations shift. Then what was considered legally fixed becomes practically negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>Each step seems defensible in isolation. This appointment was lawful. That vote was procedurally proper. This interpretation is within discretion.</p>\n\n<p>But the cumulative effect is the conversion of institutions from entities bound by statute into extensions of whoever controls the appointments.</p>\n\n<p>## What Joe Kennedy III Said</p>\n\n<p>Joe Kennedy III, former congressman and grandnephew of the president whose name Congress placed on the center, said: \"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial.\"</p>\n\n<p>He's right about the principle. The question is whether the principle still governs.</p>\n\n<p>If a board vote can rename the Kennedy Center, can a board vote rename Arlington National Cemetery? Can it redesignate the Washington Monument? Can it alter the Jefferson Memorial? All are federal property. All were designated by acts of Congress. All have boards or commissions that could, if appointment power is sufficient, vote to revise what Congress established.</p>\n\n<p>The answer should be no, because federal law constrains federal boards. But if the answer is yes when the votes align, then we've redefined what \"established by law\" means. It means established until a different political coalition controls the appointments.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Here</p>\n\n<p>A lawsuit will determine whether Representative Beatty is correct that statute prevents what the board approved. The court will decide whether congressional designation of a memorial is binding or advisory, whether a board created to govern operations can alter the institution's statutory identity, whether appointment power extends to rewriting the terms under which institutions were created.</p>\n\n<p>That decision matters beyond one building.</p>\n\n<p>If courts hold that boards have inherent authority to rename institutions regardless of statutory language, then every federal entity designated by Congress becomes contingent on who holds appointment power at any given time. Memorials become negotiable. Statutory designations become suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>If courts hold that Congress retains authority over what it creates by law unless it explicitly delegates naming authority, then law still constrains boards, and memorials remain what Congress made them.</p>\n\n<p>The broader question is whether we still distinguish between operating an institution and redefining it, between managing within statutory bounds and rewriting the statute through board action, between normal exercise of appointment power and conversion of that power into control over an institution's legal identity.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction used to be clear. If it's eroding, we should notice.</p>\n\n<p>The name is on the building now. The website is changed. The decision has been executed before the lawsuit can be heard. That's not unusual in modern governance, but it's telling. When changes happen faster than law can review them, execution becomes the argument for legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about honoring one president or another. This is about whether federal law still governs federal property when appointment power says otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>That question, in a republic, should have only one answer.</p>",
