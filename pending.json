      "headline": "When Executive Power Meets the Controlled Substances Act",
      "content": "<p>I spent years in government watching how statutory frameworks shape executive discretion. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 created five schedules, each with specific legal boundaries and enforcement mechanisms. Schedule I drugs are defined by law as having no accepted medical use and high potential for abuse. Schedule III drugs can be prescribed, researched without special licensing, and taxed differently.</p>\n\n<p>The president just directed the attorney general to move cannabis between these categories by executive order.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a policy preference. That's a question about how law works.</p>\n\n<p>The Controlled Substances Act grants the attorney general authority to schedule and reschedule drugs, but that authority operates within a statutory framework requiring findings of fact, scientific review by the Department of Health and Human Services, and adherence to treaty obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The Biden administration began this process in 2022, following the administrative procedure required by law. The DEA proposed rescheduling in April 2024, opened a comment period, and the process stalled in the regulatory machinery that governs how agencies change classifications with legal force.</p>\n\n<p>Now the same outcome arrives by different means.</p>\n\n<p>The executive order doesn't complete the administrative process. It directs that it be completed. But the language matters. An order that says \"the attorney general shall reclassify\" creates the appearance of fait accompli, while the actual legal mechanism still requires the same findings, the same scientific review, the same treaty considerations that delayed the Biden proposal.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about cannabis policy. Twenty-four states have legalized recreational use. A majority of Americans support legalization. The question of whether cannabis should remain Schedule I is not constitutionally interesting.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether executive orders can shortcut administrative law.</p>\n\n<p>## The Difference Between Direction and Decree</p>\n\n<p>I've read enough executive orders to recognize the pattern. Some direct agencies to begin a process. Others announce that a process will reach a predetermined conclusion. The distinction matters because administrative law exists to prevent exactly that: the executive branch declaring outcomes without the procedural safeguards that make those outcomes legally defensible.</p>\n\n<p>The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 requires agencies to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking when changing regulations with the force of law. Courts have consistently held that rescheduling controlled substances triggers these requirements. The process isn't mere formality. It's how administrative decisions gain legal legitimacy in a system where Congress delegates authority but retains the power to check its exercise.</p>\n\n<p>When an executive order directs an agency to reach a specific conclusion, it risks collapsing that process into a political decision dressed in administrative language.</p>\n\n<p>The defense will be that the order merely directs the attorney general to complete what the Biden administration started. But if that were true, the order would be unnecessary. The administrative process was already underway. Directing its completion in language that suggests inevitability changes the nature of what's happening.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-two Republican senators warned against this move in a letter to the president. They cited health concerns, economic arguments, and the risk of normalizing drug use. None of those objections are constitutionally significant. But their letter reveals something that is: lawmakers from the president's own party raising concerns about a policy shift that bypasses congressional input.</p>\n\n<p>Cannabis has been Schedule I since 1971. That classification has survived multiple administrations, countless bills, and decades of state-level experimentation. If the evidence now supports reclassification, that evidence should be presented through the administrative process that makes it legally binding and judicially reviewable.</p>\n\n<p>## When Shortcuts Become Precedents</p>\n\n<p>In 1952, President Truman issued an executive order seizing steel mills to prevent a strike during the Korean War. He argued that national security required immediate action. The Supreme Court ruled that the president had exceeded his authority. Justice Robert Jackson's concurring opinion established the framework courts still use: presidential power is at its maximum when acting with congressional authorization, in twilight when Congress is silent, and at its minimum when acting contrary to congressional will.</p>\n\n<p>The Controlled Substances Act gives the attorney general scheduling authority, but that authority operates within a statutory framework Congress created. When an executive order directs a specific outcome in that framework, it moves from the first category toward the second, from acting with authorization to acting in the space where congressional intent is ambiguous.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether the president can direct the attorney general to reclassify cannabis. The question is whether that direction respects the process Congress established or merely uses it as cover for a predetermined result.</p>\n\n<p>I've watched this pattern before. The War on Terror began with specific authorizations for specific threats. Those authorizations gradually expanded until surveillance programs, detention policies, and military operations persisted long after the immediate danger passed. Not because anyone decided to permanently alter the constitutional balance. Because temporary measures, once normalized, become permanent through inertia and precedent.</p>\n\n<p>Executive orders work the same way. Each one that shortcuts process makes the next shortcut easier to justify. Not through conspiracy, but through the quiet accumulation of small changes that shift where the line is drawn.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals</p>\n\n<p>The cannabis rescheduling order matters less for what it does than for what it demonstrates about how modern executive power operates. We've moved from a model where the president executes laws Congress passes to one where the president directs outcomes in areas where congressional delegation creates ambiguity.</p>\n\n<p>That shift isn't partisan. Both parties have contributed to it. But it's accelerating.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't whether you support cannabis rescheduling. The test is whether you believe the president should be able to direct regulatory outcomes by executive order, or whether those outcomes should emerge from administrative processes designed to be insulated from political pressure.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is the former, we should be honest about what we're accepting: a model of governance where the executive branch sets policy through directive rather than through the deliberative processes that give those policies legal legitimacy and democratic accountability.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is the latter, we need to ask why administrative procedures exist if they can be effectively bypassed by announcing their conclusion in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Sixty-four percent of Americans support cannabis legalization. Four hundred twenty-five thousand people work in the cannabis industry. The policy shift reflects where public opinion has moved. But public support doesn't answer the constitutional question.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is whether process still constrains power, or whether power now determines process.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unresolved, is why fifty years from now someone will read this executive order and ask how we let administrative law become what the executive branch says it is.</p>",

      "headline": "When Vengeance Becomes Policy",
      "content": "<p>I stood on a tarmac at Dover Air Force Base more times than I care to count. The silence there has weight. No speeches, no politics, just the measured steps of a carry team and the presence of flag-draped cases that once held people with names, families, reasons they believed in what they were doing.</p>\n\n<p>So I understand the impulse behind what happened Friday in Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Two National Guard soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in an ambush. The President called it an act requiring \"very serious retaliation.\" The Defense Secretary termed the response \"a declaration of vengeance.\" Seventy targets struck. More than 100 precision munitions. Eight people reported killed in additional strikes on boats in the Pacific, part of what the administration calls operations against drug smuggling.</p>\n\n<p>That's not counterterrorism doctrine. That's something else.</p>\n\n<p>## The Language Tells You What Changed</p>\n\n<p>Defense Secretary Hegseth's statement was explicit: \"This is not the beginning of a war, it is a declaration of vengeance.\"</p>\n\n<p>Read that again.</p>\n\n<p>For most of American military history, vengeance was what we specifically did not do. We conducted operations. We pursued objectives. We degraded capabilities. We created deterrence. The language mattered because the language reflected limits, constraints that separated military action in defense of national interests from something older and less bounded.</p>\n\n<p>Vengeance is personal. Vengeance is emotional. Vengeance has no natural endpoint except exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p>When a Cabinet secretary uses that word to describe official military policy, something has shifted in how we understand what the executive can order and why.</p>\n\n<p>## The Authorization Question Nobody Is Asking</p>\n\n<p>Under what authority were these strikes conducted?</p>\n\n<p>The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force permits action against those responsible for 9/11 and associated forces. ISIS is generally understood to fall under that umbrella, though the organization did not exist in 2001 and has no organizational connection to al-Qaeda beyond ideological similarity.</p>\n\n<p>But even if we accept that interpretive stretch, the AUMF authorizes military action to prevent future attacks, not to exact retribution for past ones.</p>\n\n<p>The distinction matters.</p>\n\n<p>Preventive military action requires some showing of ongoing threat. Retributive action, vengeance, requires only that someone was harmed and someone can be identified to pay for it. One operates within the law of armed conflict. The other operates by a much older code.</p>\n\n<p>Congress has not declared war. Congress has not authorized new military operations in Syria beyond the counter-ISIS mission. The strikes Friday appear to have been conducted under the President's claimed Article II authority as Commander in Chief.</p>\n\n<p>That authority exists. But it is not unlimited. It does not permit the executive to conduct military operations for any purpose at any time simply because Americans were killed.</p>\n\n<p>If it did, every terrorist attack anywhere would become a sufficient predicate for unilateral military action, transforming the executive into something the Founders specifically feared: a magistrate who could commit the nation to war on his own judgment and grievance.</p>\n\n<p>## When Temporary Becomes Permanent</p>\n\n<p>Here is what should concern us most.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. forces have been in Syria since 2014 under a mission to defeat ISIS. That mission was described as temporary, narrow, and tied to specific objectives. ISIS lost its territorial caliphate in 2019. The organization remains a threat, but as a distributed insurgency, not a quasi-state.</p>\n\n<p>Yet hundreds of U.S. troops remain.</p>\n\n<p>The mission has evolved from defeating ISIS to preventing its resurgence to protecting partners to now, apparently, something else: conducting retaliatory strikes when Americans are killed, regardless of whether those strikes degrade a specific military capability or serve a strategic objective beyond demonstrating resolve.</p>\n\n<p>This is how temporary deployments become permanent presences. This is how limited missions become openended commitments. Not through a single decision, but through gradual expansion of what the mission permits, what circumstances justify force, what purposes military power serves.</p>\n\n<p>We are conducting strikes in Syria to avenge American deaths. We are conducting strikes in the Pacific against \"drug smuggling boats,\" a category so broad and a legal theory so novel that U.S. service members reportedly fear personal legal liability. We have shifted an aircraft carrier from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean to conduct these operations.</p>\n\n<p>When did that become normal? When did we stop asking what authority permits it?</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Feared</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war precisely because the Founders understood that executives facing no constraint would use military force promiscuously. Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the President's war powers were far narrower than a monarch's, limited to defensive operations and execution of Congress's will.</p>\n\n<p>The President could repel sudden attacks. He could command forces Congress raised and deployed. He could not, on his own authority, commit the nation to sustained military operations based on his assessment of what honor or interest required.</p>\n\n<p>We have drifted very far from that understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Successive administrations, of both parties, have expanded executive authority to use force until we now accept as routine what would have horrified the Founders: a President who orders strikes across multiple countries, justifies them with decades-old authorizations written for different enemies, and describes the purpose not as national defense but as vengeance.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>Not whether the strikes were justified by the deaths of Americans. Not whether ISIS deserves what it gets. Not whether the President has the operational authority to order military action.</p>\n\n<p>The question is simpler and harder.</p>\n\n<p>Is this compatible with a republic?</p>\n\n<p>Can a nation remain a republic when the executive can order military force anywhere, for purposes ranging from counterterrorism to drug interdiction to retribution, accountable to no vote, constrained by no clear law, justified by authorities written for different wars against different enemies?</p>\n\n<p>Can a free people accept that as normal?</p>\n\n<p>I served in government long enough to know how these things happen. There is always a reason. There is always an enemy. There is always a threat that seems to justify the expansion. Nobody sets out to overthrow constitutional order. They just respond to the crisis in front of them, and the crisis never ends, so the response becomes permanent.</p>\n\n<p>That is how republics die. Not in a single act of usurpation, but in the accumulation of emergencies that never quite end and powers that never quite expire.</p>\n\n<p>Two soldiers and an interpreter died in Syria. They deserve to be mourned. Their families deserve to know their service mattered. But their deaths do not make constitutional government optional. They make it essential.</p>\n\n<p>Because if we accept that grief and anger are sufficient justification for military action, then we have accepted that the republic no longer constrains power. It only directs it.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "headline": "When the First Branch Abdicates",
      "content": "<p>I spent years in government service. Not in Congress, but near enough to watch how institutions work when they're healthy and how they fail when something fundamental shifts.</p>\n\n<p>What former members are describing isn't gridlock. It's abdication.</p>\n\n<p>Listen to what they're actually saying. Former Representative Jim Cooper: \"Congress is in a coma. It has a pulse, but not many brainwaves.\" Former Representative Charlie Dent: \"I'm most concerned about the erosion of Congress' power of the purse authorities.\" Former Representative Dan Lipinski: \"The ceding of power from Congress to the president has...reached probably the highest level of congressional deference that we have ever seen.\"</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about productivity metrics or legislative output. This is about Article I of the Constitution quietly ceasing to function as intended.</p>\n\n<p>The Framers placed Congress first in the Constitution for a reason. They gave the legislative branch the power of the purse, the power to declare war, the power to regulate commerce, the power to override presidential vetoes. These weren't suggestions. They were structural safeguards against the concentration of executive power that the Founders had fought a war to escape.</p>\n\n<p>Now watch what's happening. The executive branch imposes tariffs without congressional authorization, raising what are effectively taxes on American citizens without their representatives voting. The administration defunds agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that Congress created and funded. Pocket rescissions cancel appropriated funds. And when members of the whip team ask colleagues how they'll vote, the response is: \"Do you want a call from the president today or tomorrow?\"</p>\n\n<p>That last detail should stop you cold.</p>\n\n<p>It means the question isn't whether a member agrees with the policy. It's whether they're willing to resist direct presidential pressure. The legislature has become a permission structure for executive action rather than a separate, coequal branch.</p>\n\n<p>This is not partisan. Former members from both parties describe the same pattern. When Republicans held the White House and Congress under previous administrations, similar dynamics emerged. When Democrats did, the same. The problem isn't which party leads. The problem is that Congress has systematically surrendered its constitutional role.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the mechanics. Power has centralized in party leadership at the expense of committees. The committees that once developed expertise, built relationships across party lines, and crafted legislation through deliberation now receive instructions from the Speaker's office about what bills should contain. Members describe voting on \"messaging bills\" that will never become law, performance legislation designed for fundraising emails rather than governance.</p>\n\n<p>The work week shrunk to three and a half days in 1995 under Newt Gingrich, ostensibly to let members spend more time in their districts but actually to free up time for fundraising. The practical effect: members don't know each other. They don't build trust. Former Representative Anna Eshoo felt compelled to tell a Republican colleague, \"I want you to know that I don't view you as my enemy.\" That she felt the need to say it tells you everything about what the institution has become.</p>\n\n<p>Former Representative Jim McDermott describes what was lost: \"We didn't get barbecues together, we didn't do any of the things that used to happen on the weekends to make it a community and make compromises easier. You have to know somebody a little bit before you trust them, and getting to know somebody is not just on the floor listening to speeches, for heaven's sakes. It's watching them deal with their kids.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not nostalgia. That's describing how deliberative bodies function. Trust gets built in informal settings. Compromise happens when you understand your colleague as a human being rather than a television character playing to cameras. When legislators spend more time traveling between Washington and home districts than actually legislating, when they spend more time raising money than building relationships, the institution ceases to be deliberative.</p>\n\n<p>And when the institution isn't deliberative, it becomes reactive. Instead of Congress setting the national agenda, it responds to executive initiatives or simply ratifies them. The Constitution's structure inverts. Article II, the executive, becomes primary. Article I, the legislature, becomes secondary.</p>\n\n<p>The Capitol Police expect to process 14,000 threat assessment cases this year. Former Representative Cheri Bustos describes moving her district office out of a secure building in 2012 because she wanted to be accessible, then watching staff install panic buttons by 2023 because they didn't feel safe. Members now advise people interested in public service to run for state office instead because \"you can make a difference there.\"</p>\n\n<p>When serving in Congress requires personal security details and panic buttons, when former members actively discourage citizens from seeking the office, something has broken that matters more than any single policy dispute.</p>\n\n<p>The Framers worried constantly about tyranny. But they understood tyranny doesn't usually arrive as a coup. It arrives as a gradual accumulation of power in one branch while another branch voluntarily surrenders its authority. Madison wrote in Federalist 48 about the tendency of legislative power to absorb other branches, but he also warned that the legislature itself could become enfeebled, leaving executive power unchecked.</p>\n\n<p>That's what's happening now. Not through malice or conspiracy, but through accumulated institutional failure. Centralizing power in leadership made individual members less relevant. Shortening the work week made relationships harder to build. Turning the legislative calendar into a fundraising schedule made serious deliberation nearly impossible. Elevating partisan rhetoric over substantive work made performative politics more rewarding than actual governance.</p>\n\n<p>Each change seemed reasonable at the time. Each addressed some immediate problem or political pressure. But the cumulative effect has been to hollow out the institution that the Constitution established as the primary repository of popular sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>Former members describe colleagues asking: \"But for what purpose?\" They meant: why endure the separation from family, the constant travel, the threats, the financial sacrifice, when you can't actually legislate? When your vote is predetermined by leadership, when your committee work gets overruled by the Speaker's office, when the most you can achieve is passing messaging bills that won't become law?</p>\n\n<p>The answer used to be: because you're a member of Congress. Because you represent your constituents in the highest legislative body of the Republic. Because the Constitution vests in you and your colleagues the power to make law, appropriate funds, provide oversight, and check executive power.</p>\n\n<p>But if Congress has ceased to exercise those powers, what exactly is the job?</p>\n\n<p>This is not about any single president or any single Congress. This is about a constitutional order that depends on each branch jealously guarding its prerogatives, and one branch that has stopped doing so. When Congress allows the executive to impose tariffs without authorization, that's not the president overreaching. That's Congress failing to defend its Article I authority. When Congress permits pocket rescissions of appropriated funds, that's not executive aggression. That's legislative abdication.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution doesn't work if the parts don't function. You can't have checks and balances if one branch decides it would rather not be in the checking-and-balancing business.</p>\n\n<p>Former Representative Reid Ribble: \"I got tired of just voting on a bunch of messaging bills that were never going to be taken up by the Senate, that were all pretend.\" That word—pretend—captures something essential. Congress has become a simulation of itself. It looks like a legislature. It meets in the Capitol. Members give speeches. Bills get introduced. Votes happen.</p>\n\n<p>But the actual function—deliberating, compromising, legislating, checking executive power, appropriating funds with strings attached, exercising oversight with teeth—has atrophied.</p>\n\n<p>Some former members remain optimistic. Patrick McHenry insists you can still make a difference, that it's \"definitely a beast that you can never master, you can just seek to improve day by day.\" Former Representative Annie Kuster says \"better times will come again, but we need patriots.\"</p>\n\n<p>Maybe. But better times don't come automatically. They come when people decide the institution matters more than the immediate political advantage. They come when members choose to rebuild committees even if it means surrendering some leadership control. They come when Congress as an institution decides to reclaim its constitutional role even when that means telling a president of your own party no.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't whether any individual member can still do some good. The test is whether the institution itself functions as the Framers intended. Whether Congress as a body exercises the powers the Constitution vests in it. Whether the First Branch remains first.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, it doesn't. And when the First Branch abdicates, what fills the space isn't benevolent efficiency. It's unchecked executive power. Which is precisely what the Founders designed the Constitution to prevent.</p>\n\n<p>Former Representative Cooper teaches at Vanderbilt Law School now. He notes that his students will earn more in their first year than he made after thirty-two years in Congress. Then he says: \"But you'll have a better country as a result. And you'll have a better place for your kids and grandkids to live. Isn't that worth something?\"</p>\n\n<p>It is. But only if Congress actually functions. Only if the institution exercises its constitutional authority. Only if the First Branch remembers it's supposed to be first.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether serving is worth the sacrifice. The question is whether the institution still does what the Constitution says it should do. And if it doesn't, no amount of individual virtue changes the structural reality: power is concentrating in the executive, the legislature is deferring rather than checking, and the constitutional order is shifting in ways that may prove difficult to reverse.</p>\n\n<p>This didn't happen overnight. It happened through a thousand small surrenders, each seemingly reasonable, each addressing some immediate problem, each making the next surrender easier.</p>\n\n<p>That's how institutions die. Not with a bang but with a steady accumulation of deference, a gradual acceptance that maybe this is just how things work now, a quiet resignation that the old constitutional structure doesn't really apply anymore.</p>\n\n<p>The former members are bearing witness. They're describing what they saw and what they experienced. They're warning that the institution isn't healthy.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether anyone with current authority will act on that warning. Or whether the First Branch will continue its slow fade into irrelevance while power concentrates elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength. But only if the Union's constitutional structure actually functions.</p>",
