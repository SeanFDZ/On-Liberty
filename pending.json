      "content": "<p>The United States government is pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela. This action follows the seizure of two previous vessels carrying Venezuelan crude.</p>\n\n<p>No formal declaration of war exists. No letter of marque has been issued by Congress. No blockade has been proclaimed through diplomatic channels to neutral nations.</p>\n\n<p>Yet ships are being stopped on the high seas.</p>\n\n<p>I say this as someone who wore the uniform. The seizure of merchant vessels in international waters is an act that, throughout history, has preceded or constituted war. The British seizure of American sailors and cargo was among the causes that led to the War of 1812. Confederate commerce raiders targeting Union shipping were instruments of declared hostilities. When Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, it understood it was choosing war.</p>\n\n<p>These were not police actions. They were acts of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Sanctions Authority</p>\n\n<p>The current seizures operate under the authority of economic sanctions, primarily those imposed through executive orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. These sanctions prohibit transactions with certain Venezuelan entities and individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is straightforward: When did the interdiction of neutral shipping on the high seas become an administrative matter?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions have existed for decades. But the scope of what now happens under sanctions authorities would be unrecognizable to earlier generations. We have moved from prohibiting American companies from doing business with sanctioned entities to actively seizing vessels, often flagged to third countries, carrying goods between non-American parties.</p>\n\n<p>This expansion happened gradually. Each step was justified as necessary, proportionate, targeted. Each seizure was framed as enforcement, not escalation.</p>\n\n<p>But when enforcement requires stopping ships at sea, the question is no longer about financial compliance. It is about the projection of force beyond our borders and outside the framework that the Constitution establishes for such projections.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Understood</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power \"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\"</p>\n\n<p>Letters of marque and reprisal were the mechanism by which Congress authorized private vessels to seize enemy shipping. The Founders included this specific power because they understood that taking ships at sea was an act of such gravity it required legislative authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the President's authority as commander in chief \"would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces... while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies, all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature.\"</p>\n\n<p>The distinction was deliberate. The power to take ships, like the power to declare war, was too consequential to rest with one person.</p>\n\n<p>## The Quiet Expansion</p>\n\n<p>I served in government during a period when these authorities were expanding. The justification was always the same: We face threats that require flexibility. Traditional mechanisms are too slow. The Constitution contemplates executive action in emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>All of this contains truth. But it elides a more fundamental question.</p>\n\n<p>If the authority being exercised requires ships to be stopped, boarded, and seized, has it not crossed the threshold that the Constitution places under legislative control?</p>\n\n<p>The ships being pursued are not American-flagged. The oil being carried is not American property. The transactions being interdicted are between third parties. The legal theory is that because these transactions ultimately violate U.S. sanctions, any ship anywhere can be subject to American jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>This is not enforcement of American law within American territory. This is the assertion that American law applies extraterritorially to anyone, anywhere, whose actions we deem to violate our economic prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what we would say if another nation asserted the same authority.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela is not popular. Its government's human rights record is poor. Its economic policies have been disastrous. These facts are not in dispute.</p>\n\n<p>But constitutional principles do not depend on whether the target is sympathetic.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the United States government has the authority, through executive action alone, to interdict merchant shipping on the high seas outside any declared state of hostilities.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we have redefined what \"war powers\" means. We have decided that the seizure of vessels, historically an act of war, is now simply an administrative tool of foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then what is happening requires congressional authorization that does not currently exist.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question being avoided is this: What limits remain on executive power if the interdiction of international commerce can be conducted indefinitely, without legislative authorization, under the banner of sanctions enforcement?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions can be imposed by executive order. They can be maintained indefinitely. They can expand in scope from prohibiting American transactions to seizing third-party vessels. They require no declaration, no sunset provision, no periodic reauthorization.</p>\n\n<p>Compare this to the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces and limits such commitments to 60 days without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>The seizure of merchant vessels falls outside this framework entirely. It is treated as economic policy, not military action.</p>\n\n<p>Yet it requires warships. It involves the use of force. It is, in every practical sense, an act of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>I do not argue that sanctions are unconstitutional. I do not argue that the executive branch lacks any role in foreign affairs. I do not argue that Venezuela's government deserves support.</p>\n\n<p>I argue that the Constitution draws lines, and those lines matter.</p>\n\n<p>The power to seize ships was placed under legislative control because the Founders understood it as an act of war. That understanding has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to rename such acts so they fall outside constitutional constraints.</p>\n\n<p>When temporary measures become permanent, when extraordinary actions become routine, when the vocabulary changes but the substance remains, we are not adapting the Constitution to modern needs.</p>\n\n<p>We are evading it.</p>\n\n<p>The third tanker being pursued is not the story. The story is that we have accepted as normal what previous generations would have recognized as war, and we have done so without asking whether the constitutional architecture for such decisions still applies.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unasked, is why this matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to understand how things work when authorities want something done quickly. There are protocols. There are reviews. There are chains of command designed to ensure that even in moments of urgency, we remain a nation of laws.</p>\n\n<p>On March 15, 2025, those protocols failed.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act that evening to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order the same evening, halting the deportations until the men could have their day in court.</p>\n\n<p>The planes landed in El Salvador anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Let that fact settle. A federal judge issued an order. The executive branch ignored it. The government's defense was not that the order came too late, or that communications failed, or that some emergency made compliance impossible. The Justice Department argued that the judge had no authority to issue the order in the first place—that questions of foreign policy placed these deportations beyond judicial review.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a claim about timing. That is a claim about power.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Judge Found</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Judge Boasberg ruled that the United States government denied due process to 137 Venezuelan men it deported under the Alien Enemies Act. His opinion is careful, measured, grounded in constitutional requirement rather than political preference. The men, he found, deserved the chance to prove they were not gang members before being sent to a foreign prison. The government provided no such opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The administration will appeal. That is its right.</p>\n\n<p>But the opinion raises a question that transcends this particular case: If expedited removal allows the government to \"secretly spirit\" people to foreign custody before a court can intervene, what remains of judicial review?</p>\n\n<p>The answer the Justice Department offered in March was: nothing. When the executive acts in matters touching foreign relations, it suggested, courts should stay out.</p>\n\n<p>That position has a name. It is called unreviewable discretion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Act Itself</p>\n\n<p>The Alien Enemies Act dates to 1798. It authorizes the president, during declared war or invasion, to detain or deport nationals of hostile foreign powers. It has been used three times in our history: during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. Each time, it was invoked in the context of actual, declared war between nations.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela has not invaded the United States. Congress has not declared war. What exists instead is the government's assertion that Tren de Aragua constitutes an invasion, and that this assertion alone triggers authority under a statute designed for armed conflict between sovereign states.</p>\n\n<p>This is not originalism. This is not even creative interpretation. This is taking language written for one context and applying it to another because the language is broad enough to bear the weight.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Tren de Aragua is dangerous. Criminal organizations are dangerous. The question is whether danger alone converts police work into war, and whether calling something an invasion makes it one for constitutional purposes.</p>\n\n<p>If it does, there is no limiting principle. Any transnational criminal network becomes an invading force. Any executive can invoke wartime authority without asking Congress to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>## What Due Process Requires</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Amendment is nine words long in the relevant part: \"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not \"no citizen.\" No person.</p>\n\n<p>Due process does not mean the government cannot deport people. It means the government must provide some opportunity to contest the grounds for deportation before it acts. That opportunity can be brief. It can be limited. But it must exist.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg's ruling does not say the government was wrong to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. It does not say the men must be granted asylum, or released, or allowed to remain in the United States. It says only that they are entitled to a hearing—a chance to show that the government's factual basis for calling them gang members is mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>The administration argued that providing such hearings was impractical. The men had already been deported. They were in El Salvador, then Venezuela. Bringing them back would be costly and complicated.</p>\n\n<p>True enough.</p>\n\n<p>But the impracticality is the government's own creation. The men would still be in the United States, able to appear before an immigration judge, if the executive had not sent them to El Salvador hours after a federal court said not to.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot manufacture your own emergency and then cite the emergency as grounds for denying rights.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>This case will be remembered not for what happened to 137 Venezuelans, but for what it establishes about executive power in immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>If the government can deport people to foreign custody before a court order takes effect, and then argue that their deportation makes judicial review impractical, then every future administration has a roadmap. Act fast enough, move people far enough, and the courts cannot reach them.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a bug in the government's theory. It is the theory.</p>\n\n<p>The Justice Department did not apologize for defying Judge Boasberg's order. It argued that the order was invalid from the start—that courts have no role in reviewing deportations conducted under the Alien Enemies Act, or at least no role that can be exercised quickly enough to matter.</p>\n\n<p>If that argument prevails, the constitutional consequence is clear: There will be a category of executive action that is, for all practical purposes, unreviewable. Not because the law prohibits review, but because the government can complete the action before review occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Speed becomes immunity.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg also found probable cause to hold the administration in criminal contempt for violating his March order. The appellate court has paused that proceeding, but the question remains: What happens when the executive branch ignores a judicial order?</p>\n\n<p>In a system of separated powers, the answer cannot be \"nothing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Contempt is not a political weapon. It is the judiciary's tool for enforcing its own judgments. Without it, court orders become suggestions. The executive obeys when it agrees, defies when it does not, and suffers no consequence either way.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a constitutional republic operates. That is how power consolidates.</p>\n\n<p>The men in this case have since been returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange. Their immediate circumstances have changed. But the precedent remains. The next group of people subjected to expedited removal under the Alien Enemies Act, or any other authority the executive claims is beyond judicial reach, will face the same problem: by the time a court can rule, they will already be gone.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>This is not about immigration policy. Reasonable people can disagree about how many people should be admitted, under what conditions, and what should happen to those who enter unlawfully. Those are legitimate political questions.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether the executive branch must allow judicial review of its factual determinations before acting, or whether asserting urgency and foreign policy concerns exempts it from that requirement.</p>\n\n<p>If the latter, then we have redefined what \"due process\" means. It no longer means an opportunity to be heard before deprivation. It means an opportunity the government will provide if convenient, and decline if not.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a small change. It is a transformation of the relationship between the citizen—or the person, because the Constitution says person—and the state.</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist 47 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands\" is \"the very definition of tyranny.\" He was describing concentration within a single branch. But the same danger exists when one branch can act beyond the reach of the others—when it moves too fast for law to catch it, and then argues that speed itself makes accountability impossible.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that principle tested.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether Judge Boasberg's ruling will stand, or whether the government's theory will prevail: that in matters the executive declares urgent, involving people it declares dangerous, the constitutional requirement of due process dissolves into discretion.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in uniform. I understand operational necessity. I also understand the difference between a military operation conducted under legal authority and the seizure of assets that belongs in a different century entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The United States has deployed 15,000 troops to the Caribbean, ordered a naval blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers, seized at least two vessels, announced it will keep or sell both the ships and their cargo, and stated it is pursuing a third. The largest deployment to the region since the 1989 Panama invasion. The president has declared he will appropriate the property of a sovereign nation without compensation, without judicial process, without treaty authorization.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Venezuela's government. This is about what power claims it may do.</p>\n\n<p>## The Authority Question</p>\n\n<p>The stated justification is drug interdiction. Fentanyl, cocaine, organized crime. Legitimate national security concerns, all of them. But the constitutional framework for using military force abroad is narrow and specific. Congress declares war. The president may act in genuine emergencies under the War Powers Resolution. Treaty obligations create mutual defense commitments within defined boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is none of these things.</p>\n\n<p>A blockade is an act of war under international law. Seizing commercial vessels on the high seas and declaring you will sell their cargo is, as Venezuela's UN ambassador noted, difficult to distinguish from piracy. The United States does not recognize the Maduro government as legitimate. Fair enough. But non-recognition does not grant authority to appropriate property. If it did, we could seize the assets of every government we consider illegitimate. That is not law. That is might.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Ambassador to the UN offered this defense: \"Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claims to power and his narco-terrorist activities.\" Perhaps true. But the Constitution does not authorize the president to decide which foreign leaders are legitimate, seize their nations' resources, and redistribute them as he sees fit. That power, if it exists at all, would require congressional authorization. It would require a legal framework. It would require something other than a presidential announcement that we are taking ships and keeping what we find.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern That Should Concern Us</p>\n\n<p>This is the fourth such operation in recent months. More than 20 vessels targeted in the Pacific and Caribbean. At least 90 people killed in strikes the administration describes as counter-gang operations. Some legal experts suggest these actions may violate the laws of armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether drug trafficking is a serious problem. It is. The question is whether the seriousness of the problem justifies abandoning the legal constraints that distinguish a republic from an empire.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the mechanism. The president declares a threat. The president orders military action. The president seizes property. The president announces he will liquidate that property for U.S. benefit. Where in that sequence is congressional authorization? Where is judicial review? Where is the check on executive power that prevents \"national security\" from becoming a blank authorization for anything the president deems necessary?</p>\n\n<p>This is not hypothetical. I watched extraordinary authorities granted after September 11th become permanent features of government. Temporary surveillance powers that were never relinquished. Detention policies that started as emergency measures and became standard procedure. The slow migration from \"we must do this now\" to \"this is simply what we do.\"</p>\n\n<p>## What the Framers Understood</p>\n\n<p>The men who wrote the Constitution had recent experience with unchecked executive power. They had lived under a king who claimed the authority to seize property, wage war, and govern by decree. They designed a system specifically to prevent that concentration of power in one person.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison, Federalist 47: \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"</p>\n\n<p>We are watching the accumulation Madison warned against. Not through dramatic coup, but through the quiet assertion that the president may do what he judges necessary. That military force may be deployed, ships seized, and property liquidated based on executive determination alone. That the complexity of modern threats requires we trust the judgment of whoever holds the office.</p>\n\n<p>The Framers would not have trusted that judgment. They did not design a system that required trusting it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent</p>\n\n<p>Russia's UN ambassador called this \"a template for future acts of force against Latin American states.\" He is not wrong to worry. If the United States may seize the assets of any nation whose government we consider illegitimate, whose oil sales we believe fund activities we oppose, then we have announced a doctrine with no limiting principle.</p>\n\n<p>Today it is Venezuela and drug trafficking. Tomorrow it could be any nation, any resource, any stated justification. The legal architecture, once abandoned, is difficult to rebuild. The precedent, once set, becomes permission.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics drift toward something else. Not through sudden transformation, but through the steady expansion of what power claims it may do without asking permission.</p>\n\n<p>## What Should Be Asked</p>\n\n<p>Is there congressional authorization for this blockade?</p>\n\n<p>Under what legal framework does the president claim authority to seize foreign commercial vessels and appropriate their cargo?</p>\n\n<p>If this action is justified by Venezuela's status as a narco-state, what prevents the same reasoning from applying to any nation we accuse of facilitating drug trade?</p>\n\n<p>Who reviews these decisions? Who checks them?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is \"the president decides,\" then we have answered a different question than we intended.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>The argument will be made that this is different. That Venezuela is uniquely problematic, that Maduro is uniquely illegitimate, that the drug crisis is uniquely urgent. Perhaps. But constitutional principle does not operate on a curve graded by how much we dislike the target.</p>\n\n<p>Either we are a nation that operates under law, or we are a nation that operates under power. Either military force abroad requires legal authorization, or it requires only executive will. Either property seizures follow due process, or they follow presidential announcement.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot be both. And we are deciding, right now, which we will be.</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath did not include an asterisk for difficult cases. It did not include an exception for serious threats. It meant what it said: that the framework matters more than the outcome, that the process protects everyone, and that power exercised without legal constraint is not legitimate power regardless of its objective.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about defending Venezuela's government. This is about defending the system that prevents any government, including ours, from doing whatever it believes necessary.</p>\n\n<p>That system is being tested. The test is happening now.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The Department of Justice announced this week that it has discovered more than a million additional documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. They promise release \"in the coming days and weeks.\" The statement did not explain how these documents, which presumably existed during the initial review, were only now discovered.</p>\n\n<p>That's the detail that matters.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Epstein. The crimes are known. The victims are known. The dead cannot be brought to trial.</p>\n\n<p>This is about what a government owes its people when it says \"we have disclosed everything,\" and then months later says \"we have found a million more pages.\"</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in government service. I've reviewed classified materials under deadline pressure. I know what \"we're working around the clock\" means when spoken by lawyers protecting institutional interests rather than serving constitutional obligations.</p>\n\n<p>It means the clock started late.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We've Seen Before</p>\n\n<p>Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The law was specific: release all documents, redact only to protect victims and active investigations, do not redact to prevent embarrassment or reputational harm, and meet a deadline of December 19.</p>\n\n<p>The Department missed the deadline.</p>\n\n<p>The initial releases were heavily redacted, including names of possible co-conspirators whom the FBI had served with subpoenas in 2019. Lawmakers from both parties objected. The law clearly prohibited those redactions.</p>\n\n<p>Now we learn there are a million more documents that somehow weren't part of the initial inventory.</p>\n\n<p>The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required full disclosure by 2017. In 2017, agencies requested more time. They are still requesting more time. Documents from 1963 remain classified in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is this: Congress passes a transparency law. Agencies comply minimally. Years pass. The public's attention moves on. What was mandatory becomes negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>The law does not enforce itself.</p>\n\n<p>## What \"Review\" Means</p>\n\n<p>The Department says lawyers are \"working around the clock\" to review these newly discovered documents. This is presented as diligence. It is more accurately described as delay.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act is explicit about what may be redacted: victim identities and information that would compromise active criminal investigations. That's it. The law specifically states that embarrassment and reputational harm are not grounds for redaction.</p>\n\n<p>If the law means what it says, review should be straightforward. Find victim names, redact them. Check for overlap with ongoing prosecutions, redact those specific items. Release everything else.</p>\n\n<p>If review takes \"a few more weeks\" for a million documents, that's not document review. That's interest balancing. It's deciding which powerful people can be protected under a permissive interpretation of \"active investigation.\" It's determining how much the statute really means.</p>\n\n<p>This is how law stops being law and becomes suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>I've been part of classification reviews. When institutions want transparency, documents move quickly. When they don't, every page requires three meetings and a legal memo.</p>\n\n<p>Speed reveals intent.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Co-Conspirators</p>\n\n<p>Embedded in the already-released documents are FBI emails from 2019 mentioning ten possible co-conspirators. Six had been served with subpoenas. Three in Florida. One in Boston. One in New York. One in Connecticut.</p>\n\n<p>Their names are redacted.</p>\n\n<p>The law prohibits redaction to prevent embarrassment. Were these six people charged? If not, on what basis did the FBI decline prosecution? Those are the internal communications and memos the statute specifically requires.</p>\n\n<p>Epstein died in federal custody in 2019. Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2022. The investigation is not new. The FBI identified possible co-conspirators, served them with subpoenas, and made charging decisions years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Why are we still waiting to know who they were and why they weren't charged?</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a question about Jeffrey Epstein. It's a question about whether law applies differently to people with power and proximity to power.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we do not have equal justice. We have a system where connection determines consequence. And if that's the system, citizens deserve to know it plainly rather than discover it through redaction patterns and missed deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Requires</p>\n\n<p>Transparency is not a favor governments grant when convenient. It is a structural requirement of legitimate authority.</p>\n\n<p>When Congress passes a law requiring disclosure, that law represents the people's judgment that they are entitled to know what their government did and did not do. The executive branch does not have discretion to comply partially or slowly unless the law provides that discretion.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act provided limited discretion: protect victims and active investigations. Everything else must be released.</p>\n\n<p>If a million documents were somehow overlooked, that is not a reason for more time. It is evidence that the initial review was inadequate. The remedy is not another months-long review at the same pace. The remedy is to release everything not clearly covered by the two statutory exceptions, and let citizens see what their government has been doing.</p>\n\n<p>Trust is not rebuilt through promises of future transparency. It is rebuilt through present action.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>This case will clarify something important. Either the law means what it says, or it means what is convenient.</p>\n\n<p>If names are redacted because releasing them would be embarrassing, the law has been broken, and Congress should enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>If the \"review process\" continues indefinitely while public attention wanes, we will know that transparency laws are performative, not binding.</p>\n\n<p>If co-conspirators who were investigated but not charged remain unnamed because they are powerful or connected, we will know that equal justice is an aspiration rather than a practice.</p>\n\n<p>The facts are straightforward. The law is clear. What happens next will tell us whether clarity matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I've worked in government buildings named for people who served this country. You walk through those halls conscious of the names on the walls, the portraits in the lobbies, the dedications carved in stone. They aren't decorations. They're reminders of what the institution is supposed to serve.</p>\n\n<p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was created by federal law. Congress authorized it. Congress funded it. Congress named it after a president who had been assassinated in office. The statute establishing it, Public Law 88-260, enacted January 23, 1964, declares it \"a living memorial\" and \"the National Center for the Performing Arts.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not political preference. That's law.</p>\n\n<p>Now the sitting president has placed his own name on that memorial. A board he reconstituted voted unanimously to rename it. A congresswoman designated by statute as a board member says she was muted when she tried to object. The name went up on the building within hours.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about partisan alignment. This is about whether federal law governs federal property, or whether control of appointments means control of outcomes previously thought to be fixed by statute.</p>\n\n<p>## The Legal Question Nobody Is Answering</p>\n\n<p>Representative Beatty's lawsuit argues that renaming the Kennedy Center requires an act of Congress, not a board resolution. The White House says the board acted properly under its authority.</p>\n\n<p>That's a factual legal question with a factual legal answer.</p>\n\n<p>Either the authorizing statute allows the board to change the name of the institution, or it doesn't. Either Congress retains authority over the designation of federal memorials it creates, or control passes entirely to whoever holds appointment power over the board.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what we know: Public Law 88-260 names the institution. It doesn't delegate naming authority to the board. It establishes the center as a memorial to John F. Kennedy. The Supreme Court has long held that when Congress creates something by statute and specifies its essential characteristics, those characteristics cannot be altered except by Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The board has authority over operations, programming, fundraising. That's governance. Changing the name of a congressionally designated memorial is not governance. It's revision of the statute itself.</p>\n\n<p>If a board vote can rename a federal memorial established by law, then law is subordinate to appointment power. That's not a small shift. That's the difference between a government of laws and a government of loyalties.</p>\n\n<p>## How Boards Become Instruments</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after taking office, President Trump removed multiple Kennedy Center board members and replaced them with appointees. Thirty-four of fifty-seven members now serve at his appointment. His close adviser became board president. He became board chairman.</p>\n\n<p>That's within presidential authority. Appointment power is real power.</p>\n\n<p>But when appointment power converts a statutory board into a unanimous instrument, we're watching something beyond normal governance. When a congresswoman says she was silenced during a vote to alter what Congress created by law, we're watching process become performance.</p>\n\n<p>The White House statement justifies the name change by citing Trump's financial support for the center, his securing of congressional appropriations, his leadership of renovations. All of that may be true. None of it changes what statute requires.</p>\n\n<p>You don't earn the right to rename federal memorials by funding them. If that were the standard, every major donor could demand naming rights over national institutions. The Lincoln Memorial would be available for the highest bidder with enough friends in the right positions.</p>\n\n<p>This is why memorials are created by law, not by board resolution.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We're Watching</p>\n\n<p>This isn't the first time statutory constraints have dissolved under appointment power. It won't be the last.</p>\n\n<p>What's being normalized is the idea that control over an institution's board means control over the institution's identity, regardless of what the statute establishing it provides. That the person who appoints can become the thing appointed. That what Congress designates by law can be redesignated by voice vote if enough board seats change hands.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this pattern before, not in memorials but in regulatory agencies, in inspector general offices, in bodies designed to operate with some independence from the executive. First, the appointments change. Then the interpretations shift. Then what was considered legally fixed becomes practically negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>Each step seems defensible in isolation. This appointment was lawful. That vote was procedurally proper. This interpretation is within discretion.</p>\n\n<p>But the cumulative effect is the conversion of institutions from entities bound by statute into extensions of whoever controls the appointments.</p>\n\n<p>## What Joe Kennedy III Said</p>\n\n<p>Joe Kennedy III, former congressman and grandnephew of the president whose name Congress placed on the center, said: \"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial.\"</p>\n\n<p>He's right about the principle. The question is whether the principle still governs.</p>\n\n<p>If a board vote can rename the Kennedy Center, can a board vote rename Arlington National Cemetery? Can it redesignate the Washington Monument? Can it alter the Jefferson Memorial? All are federal property. All were designated by acts of Congress. All have boards or commissions that could, if appointment power is sufficient, vote to revise what Congress established.</p>\n\n<p>The answer should be no, because federal law constrains federal boards. But if the answer is yes when the votes align, then we've redefined what \"established by law\" means. It means established until a different political coalition controls the appointments.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Here</p>\n\n<p>A lawsuit will determine whether Representative Beatty is correct that statute prevents what the board approved. The court will decide whether congressional designation of a memorial is binding or advisory, whether a board created to govern operations can alter the institution's statutory identity, whether appointment power extends to rewriting the terms under which institutions were created.</p>\n\n<p>That decision matters beyond one building.</p>\n\n<p>If courts hold that boards have inherent authority to rename institutions regardless of statutory language, then every federal entity designated by Congress becomes contingent on who holds appointment power at any given time. Memorials become negotiable. Statutory designations become suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>If courts hold that Congress retains authority over what it creates by law unless it explicitly delegates naming authority, then law still constrains boards, and memorials remain what Congress made them.</p>\n\n<p>The broader question is whether we still distinguish between operating an institution and redefining it, between managing within statutory bounds and rewriting the statute through board action, between normal exercise of appointment power and conversion of that power into control over an institution's legal identity.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction used to be clear. If it's eroding, we should notice.</p>\n\n<p>The name is on the building now. The website is changed. The decision has been executed before the lawsuit can be heard. That's not unusual in modern governance, but it's telling. When changes happen faster than law can review them, execution becomes the argument for legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about honoring one president or another. This is about whether federal law still governs federal property when appointment power says otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>That question, in a republic, should have only one answer.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have watched governments fall. I have seen coups unfold. I have served in regions where the difference between legitimate authority and raw power was measured in the willingness to use force against citizens.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in Myanmar is not an election. It is a performance of legitimacy staged at gunpoint.</p>\n\n<p>The military junta is holding what it calls \"phased elections\" beginning December 28. Nearly 100 people have been arrested for questioning this process. Some face prison for clicking \"like\" on social media posts critical of the vote. The opposition National League for Democracy is banned. Its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been imprisoned since the 2021 coup. Her son recently told reporters, \"For all I know, she could be dead.\"</p>\n\n<p>The military admits the vote will not be held in half the country, the contested and rebel-held areas.</p>\n\n<p>The United Nations Secretary General asked the obvious question: \"Is there anyone who believes that there will be free and fair elections in Myanmar?\"</p>\n\n<p>But here is the question beneath that question: What happens when a government performs the rituals of democracy while systematically destroying its substance?</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Myanmar's internal politics. This is about the mechanics of legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>**The Architecture of Sham Democracy**</p>\n\n<p>Elections are not merely procedures. They are the foundational mechanism by which free people delegate authority and retain the power to revoke it. When a government holds an election it controls completely, bans opposition parties, imprisons critics, and deploys force to ensure the desired outcome, it is not seeking the consent of the governed. It is demanding the performance of consent.</p>\n\n<p>The junta has passed laws criminalizing \"interference\" in the election. That word carries the full weight of state power: 200 arrests and counting for social media posts, for expressing doubt, for failing to participate in the charade.</p>\n\n<p>This is not election administration. This is compelled speech.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" The entire structure of constitutional government rests on the assumption that those who hold power must be accountable to those they govern. That accountability requires more than the theater of voting. It requires the genuine possibility of losing power.</p>\n\n<p>What Myanmar's military has constructed is a system where elections exist not as instruments of accountability but as rituals of submission.</p>\n\n<p>**The Exhaustion of Resistance**</p>\n\n<p>Here is what five years of civil war does to a population: it creates a longing for anything that resembles stability, even if that stability is the boot heel of military rule.</p>\n\n<p>Analyst David Mathieson reports hearing from citizens who say, \"We hate the regime, but at least they've got a plan, they've got a way to kind of get us out of this and stabilize.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not endorsement. That is capitulation born of exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p>This is how extraordinary measures become normalized. Not through persuasion or even through force alone, but through the grinding down of alternatives until people accept unfreedom as the price of predictability.</p>\n\n<p>Ko Ta Mar, a doctor who became a rebel commander, calls the election \"like injecting steroids into a patient. The pain can be eased temporarily, but it will be worse in the long term.\"</p>\n\n<p>He is describing the difference between symptom relief and cure, between the appearance of legitimacy and its substance. But after nearly five years of war, economic collapse, and displacement affecting millions, many citizens simply want the pain to stop, even temporarily, even if it means accepting a government they did not choose.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Myanmar's people prefer the junta. The question is whether they have been given any meaningful choice at all.</p>\n\n<p>**When Legitimacy Becomes Transactional**</p>\n\n<p>China has endorsed Myanmar's election. So has Russia. India maintains ambiguous support. Beijing's calculation is coldly practical: the military junta is \"a necessary evil\" that serves Chinese strategic interests better than continued chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Yun Sun of the Stimson Center explains China's position: \"Five years of civil war did not kick them out, and the Chinese will not tilt the balance of power in a way that the military will be forced out.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is legitimacy as transaction. Not legitimacy earned through the consent of the governed, but legitimacy purchased through the endorsement of powerful neighbors who value stability over freedom.</p>\n\n<p>China has pressured ethnic armed groups to stop fighting the junta. It has restricted weapons supplies to opposition forces. It has treated Myanmar's election not as a question of democratic principle but as an instrument of regional order.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question here extends beyond Myanmar's borders: When powerful states recognize and validate governments that lack domestic legitimacy, do they create a separate category of international legitimacy that exists independent of popular consent?</p>\n\n<p>This is not a new question. It was the question at the heart of the Cold War, when the United States and Soviet Union both propped up client regimes regardless of how those regimes came to power. But it remains urgent because it determines whether popular sovereignty is a universal principle or merely a preferred arrangement in friendly nations.</p>\n\n<p>**What Is Being Normalized**</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's election will likely produce a parliament dominated by the military's proxy party. The junta will declare the result a mandate. Some nations will accept that claim. The military will use the election as evidence of restored constitutional order, even as opposition leaders remain in prison and half the country remains too dangerous to vote.</p>\n\n<p>What is being established here is a precedent: that the forms of democracy can substitute for its substance, that elections can exist without genuine choice, that governments can claim legitimacy through processes they control completely.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an Asian problem or a developing world problem. It is the central question of republican government: whether authority derives from the consent of the governed or merely from the successful monopolization of force.</p>\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin, emerging from the Constitutional Convention in 1787, was asked what kind of government the delegates had created. He replied: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"</p>\n\n<p>The keeping of a republic requires constant vigilance against the substitution of process for principle, against the performance of democracy without its substance, against elections that function as referenda on submission rather than instruments of choice.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's military is gambling that exhaustion will produce acquiescence, that the appearance of normalcy will be accepted as normalcy itself, that international recognition will substitute for domestic legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>The gamble may work. Five years of war have worn down resistance. China's support provides economic lifelines and diplomatic cover. The opposition remains fractured and outgunned.</p>\n\n<p>But what succeeds tactically may fail constitutionally. A government that must imprison critics to hold elections, that must ban opposition parties to ensure victory, that must control half the country by force to govern the other half through votes, has not achieved legitimacy. It has achieved compliance.</p>\n\n<p>The difference matters. Compliance is temporary. It lasts only as long as force can be maintained. Legitimacy is durable. It survives changes in leadership and shifts in power because it rests on consent rather than coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's military is constructing a house of cards and calling it a foundation. The structure may stand for years. It may even function as government. But it will not be legitimate, no matter how many elections it holds or how many foreign powers recognize the result.</p>\n\n<p>The test is simple: Can the people change their government through peaceful means? If the answer is no, the government does not rest on consent. If the government does not rest on consent, it is not legitimate, no matter what forms it observes or what elections it holds.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a partisan claim. That is constitutional bedrock.</p>\n\n<p>The question for the rest of us is whether we are prepared to say so.</p>",

The alarm sounds. On screen, missiles rise in balls of fire. Mushroom clouds blossom across the planet.</p>\n\n<p>It's a macabre tourist attraction now. Once it was Ukraine's insurance policy.</p>\n\n<p>In 1994, Ukraine possessed the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. Ten years later, every warhead was gone, dismantled under the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and Britain. The terms were clear: Ukraine would surrender its nuclear weapons. In exchange, the three co-signers guaranteed Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>Russia invaded in 2014. It invaded again in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a story about nuclear proliferation. This is a story about what happens when security guarantees are worth less than the paper they're written on.</p>\n\n<p>**When Assurances Replace Obligation**</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum was not a treaty. That matters.</p>\n\n<p>A treaty requires Senate ratification under Article II of the Constitution. It creates binding obligations enforceable under international law. The Budapest Memorandum was a political commitment, a gentleman's agreement among nuclear powers that one of them would not invade the country that had just given up the means to defend itself.</p>\n\n<p>President Clinton called it \"a hopeful and historic breakthrough.\" Ukraine's then-president, Leonid Kravchuk, believed the word of three nuclear powers meant something.</p>\n\n<p>The museum guide, Hennadiy Vladimirovitch Fil, says hardly anyone of a certain age leaves without cursing. They understand now what they gave away. Denmark's ambassador to Kyiv, visiting the museum, calls it \"a disgrace.\" Even Clinton later admitted: \"I feel terrible about it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Words without enforcement are wishes. Security without accountability is theater.</p>\n\n<p>**The Architecture of Deterrence**</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that republics survive not through the goodwill of other nations but through the credible threat of force. As Hamilton wrote in Federalist 34, \"A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine's nuclear arsenal was precisely such a power. Ten ICBMs, each carrying ten warheads, each capable of obliterating 77,000 square miles. These were not symbolic weapons. They were instruments of mutual assured destruction, the Cold War doctrine that kept the peace precisely because no rational actor would risk annihilation.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine surrendered that deterrent on the promise that it wouldn't need it.</p>\n\n<p>Russia tested the promise in 2014 with Crimea. The West condemned the action but took no military steps to reverse it. The promise held as long as Russia chose not to break it further. In 2022, Russia broke it entirely.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when deterrence rests on assurances rather than capability. The strong do what they can. The weak suffer what they must.</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Good Faith**</p>\n\n<p>Museum visitors watch a simulation of nuclear war: oxygen depleting from the atmosphere, life ending on the planet. Fil is grateful it never came to that. But he regrets that Ukraine gave up its weapons.</p>\n\n<p>The regret is not about wanting nuclear war. It's about recognizing that the international order operates not on justice but on power.</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum assumed good faith from all signatories. It assumed that Russia, having just emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union, would respect the sovereignty of its neighbors. It assumed that the United States and Britain, having brokered the deal, would enforce it if Russia didn't.</p>\n\n<p>All three assumptions were wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution does not assume good faith. It constructs a government on the premise that people are not angels. As Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>The international order assumed angels. Ukraine is paying the price.</p>\n\n<p>**What This Museum Teaches**</p>\n\n<p>The Museum of Strategic Missile Forces is a warning in concrete and steel. It documents how a nation voluntarily disarmed, how it trusted written assurances from nuclear powers, and how those assurances collapsed the moment they were tested.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is now demanding \"ironclad security guarantees\" as part of any peace deal with Russia. The word \"ironclad\" is doing heavy lifting. What makes a guarantee ironclad? Not signatures. Not diplomatic language. Not the prestige of the signatories.</p>\n\n<p>Guarantees are ironclad when they are backed by the credible threat of enforcement. Treaties work when violation carries consequences that the violator cannot afford. The Budapest Memorandum failed because Russia calculated, correctly, that it could invade without triggering a military response from the other signatories.</p>\n\n<p>A museum guide who once served in the Soviet rocket forces now takes tourists underground to press a launch button that does nothing. The missiles are gone. The silos are filled with concrete. The deterrent is a historical exhibit.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when nations trade power for promises.</p>\n\n<p>**The Constitutional Question**</p>\n\n<p>The United States did not violate the Constitution by signing the Budapest Memorandum. The executive branch has authority to conduct foreign policy and enter into non-treaty agreements. But the decision to use a memorandum rather than a treaty meant that the commitment had no force of law, no mechanism for enforcement, and no obligation beyond diplomatic pressure.</p>\n\n<p>The Senate never voted on whether to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity. The American people never consented to a binding obligation. The memorandum allowed the executive branch to project the appearance of a security guarantee without accepting the accountability that comes with one.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about whether the United States should have gone to war to defend Ukraine in 2014 or 2022. This is about whether we should have made a promise we had no intention of keeping.</p>\n\n<p>When the executive branch makes commitments that look like treaties but lack treaty obligations, it creates confusion about what America actually stands behind. It encourages allies to trust assurances that may not hold. It teaches adversaries that American promises are negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>The museum in Ukraine stands as a monument to that confusion.</p>\n\n<p>**What Visitors Learn**</p>\n\n<p>They learn that nuclear weapons are terrible. They learn that the Cold War arms race brought humanity to the edge of extinction. They learn that Ukraine once had the power to destroy cities on another continent and gave it up in the name of peace.</p>\n\n<p>They also learn that power, once surrendered, is not returned when you need it most.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Ukraine should have kept its nuclear weapons. The question is whether great powers should make security guarantees they cannot or will not enforce. The question is whether assurances without accountability serve any purpose beyond postponing the inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine believed the promises of three nuclear powers. Russia broke its promise. The United States and Britain honored theirs only through diplomatic protest.</p>\n\n<p>The museum guide, Hennadiy Fil, now shows tourists how to simulate launching missiles that no longer exist. The button still works. The alarm still sounds. On screen, the world still ends.</p>\n\n<p>But the real missiles were destroyed in the 1990s, filled with concrete, turned into museum pieces. Ukraine trusted that it wouldn't need them.</p>\n\n<p>That trust is what the museum commemorates. Not just the weapons. The belief that written assurances from powerful nations meant something.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in the Pacific. I know what military exercises are. They are rehearsals.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing around Taiwan is not posturing. It is preparation.</p>\n\n<p>On December 29, the People's Liberation Army conducted joint drills encircling Taiwan—air, navy, rocket forces. Live fire scheduled. Five zones marked. Beijing called it a \"stern warning\" against separatism and external interference. Taiwan called it aggression. Both statements are true. Neither captures what is actually happening.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Taiwan's status. That question has been unresolved since 1949. This is about whether international order rests on law or on the willingness to enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>## What Changed</p>\n\n<p>Three things converged to trigger these drills: a $10 billion U.S. arms package to Taiwan, Japan's new prime minister stating Tokyo might intervene militarily if China moves on Taiwan, and the routine reality that Beijing sends warplanes and naval vessels toward the island nearly every day.</p>\n\n<p>That last point matters most.</p>\n\n<p>These exercises are no longer exceptional. They are regular. What was once crisis is now pattern. Beijing has normalized military pressure to the point where live-fire drills around a democratic nation of 23 million people barely register as news.</p>\n\n<p>The normalization of the extraordinary is how republics lose their way.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States is obligated to assist Taiwan's defense. That law emerged from a specific compromise: President Carter's administration recognized Beijing diplomatically while maintaining an informal commitment to Taiwan's security. For decades, this arrangement preserved an uneasy peace.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether that obligation retains meaning when the threat is constant rather than acute.</p>\n\n<p>When military exercises become daily background noise, when blockade rehearsals happen on a schedule, when \"precision strikes on key targets\" are announced in press releases, the nature of the threat has changed. It is no longer a crisis that might be deterred. It is a steady pressure designed to exhaust resistance before force is ever used.</p>\n\n<p>This matters constitutionally because it tests whether treaty obligations and statutory commitments can function when the adversary operates below the threshold that triggers response. Beijing is not invading Taiwan. It is surrounding it, drilling around it, flying over it, testing it. At what point does that pattern constitute the threat the Taiwan Relations Act was designed to address?</p>\n\n<p>Congress has not answered that question. It may not be answerable in advance. But the failure to ask it aloud means we are drifting toward a moment when the question will be answered by events rather than by deliberate choice.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>What is happening around Taiwan is being watched everywhere territorial disputes remain unresolved. The lesson being transmitted is this: if you have the patience and the military capacity to make the extraordinary routine, you can shift facts on the ground without firing a shot.</p>\n\n<p>This is not new in history. It is how empires have expanded for millennia. What is new is the precision with which it can be executed and the speed with which democratic publics become desensitized to it.</p>\n\n<p>When I was in uniform, we understood that readiness was not just about our own capability. It was about credibility. The adversary had to believe we would do what we said we would do. That belief was the deterrent. The moment that belief weakened, the deterrent collapsed, and the cost of restoring it became exponentially higher.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, credibility is being tested daily. Not through dramatic confrontation, but through incremental pressure that forces the question: at what point does the United States honor its commitment, and how will it know when that point has arrived?</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals About Power and Accountability</p>\n\n<p>The drills around Taiwan expose a deeper problem: the gap between stated policy and operational reality. Washington has committed to Taiwan's defense. But that commitment has never been defined with precision. It rests on strategic ambiguity, a doctrine that worked for decades but may no longer function when the threat is not a singular invasion but a slow encirclement.</p>\n\n<p>Strategic ambiguity requires restraint on all sides. It requires Beijing to refrain from forcing the issue and Washington to refrain from clarifying its response. But when one side stops exercising restraint, the ambiguity collapses. What remains is not strategy but drift.</p>\n\n<p>This is the accountability question: Who decides when the commitment is triggered? The President? Congress? A general in the field reading radar screens as Chinese aircraft approach Taiwan's air defense zone for the 300th time this year?</p>\n\n<p>If that decision is left undefined, it will be made in crisis, under pressure, with incomplete information. That is how wars begin that no one intended to fight.</p>\n\n<p>## The Historical Echo</p>\n\n<p>There is a parallel here to the 1930s, though not the one usually invoked. This is not about appeasement in the face of open aggression. This is about the slow accumulation of facts that make aggression seem inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Before 1939, there were remilitarizations, annexations, provocations. Each one tested whether the international order would respond. Each time the response was delayed or diluted, the next provocation became easier. The problem was not that democracies failed to recognize the threat. The problem was that they failed to recognize the cumulative weight of small violations.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that accumulation now. Not in Europe, but in the Pacific. Not with tanks rolling across borders, but with naval forces surrounding an island, air forces penetrating airspace, and rocket forces rehearsing strikes.</p>\n\n<p>The accumulation is the threat. The normalization is the danger.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>Here is the question that is not being asked: What is the constitutional process by which the United States would honor its commitment to Taiwan?</p>\n\n<p>Not the moral question. Not the strategic question. The constitutional question.</p>\n\n<p>If Beijing blockades Taiwan, does the President have authority to respond militarily without congressional authorization? If Congress has that authority, has it delegated it through the Taiwan Relations Act, or must it vote again? If a vote is required, how quickly can it happen when the window for effective response may be measured in hours?</p>\n\n<p>These are not abstract questions. They are the questions that determine whether our commitments are real or rhetorical.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that the power to make war had to be shared between Congress and the executive precisely because war was too consequential to be left to any single authority. But they also understood that speed sometimes mattered, which is why the President commands the armed forces once war is authorized.</p>\n\n<p>What they did not envision was a world where war could be waged incrementally, where the line between peace and conflict could be so blurred that no one could say with certainty when it had been crossed.</p>\n\n<p>That is the world we inhabit now. And our constitutional system has not adapted to it.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Means for Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy in a republic rests on consent. The people, through their representatives, decide when to go to war. That principle is foundational. It is why the Constitution gives Congress, not the President, the power to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>But if military conflict can begin without a declaration, if commitments can be triggered without a vote, if the executive can commit forces based on decades-old statutory language that was intentionally ambiguous, then the consent of the governed becomes theoretical rather than real.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an argument against defending Taiwan. It is an argument for clarity about how that defense would be authorized and by whom.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we have neither clarity nor public debate. We have policy by drift, strategy by assumption, and commitment by implication. That is not how a constitutional republic is supposed to function.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>These drills are a test. Not just of military capability, but of political will. Not just of Taiwan's resilience, but of America's seriousness.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether the United States should defend Taiwan. The question is whether we have defined what defense means, authorized the means to carry it out, and prepared the public for what it might require.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer to any of those questions is no, then the commitment is hollow. And hollow commitments do not deter adversaries. They invite miscalculation.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 41 that the powers of government must be adequate to the security of the nation. Adequate. Not excessive, but sufficient. Right now, the adequacy of our constitutional process to meet the threat being rehearsed around Taiwan is unproven.</p>\n\n<p>That is the meaning of these drills. They are not just a rehearsal for Beijing. They are a test of whether our system can respond coherently when the threat arrives not as Pearl Harbor but as a thousand small incursions that accumulate into encirclement.</p>\n\n<p>The test is here.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served under commanders who understood that security guarantees mean something specific. They are not aspirations. They are commitments backed by the full weight of American power, and they bind not just one administration but the Republic itself.</p>\n\n<p>That's why what happened at Mar-a-Lago matters.</p>\n\n<p>The President of the United States offered Ukraine a fifteen-year security guarantee. The President of Ukraine asked for fifty. Both men spoke as if these were terms in a real estate negotiation, numbers to be haggled over, percentages to be quoted to reporters.</p>\n\n<p>Neither man appears to have asked the question that the Constitution requires: By what authority?</p>\n\n<p>## What a Guarantee Means</p>\n\n<p>A security guarantee is not a policy preference. It is a commitment that American forces will respond to aggression against another nation. It is, in substance if not in form, a mutual defense treaty.</p>\n\n<p>The North Atlantic Treaty, ratified in 1949, commits the United States to consider an armed attack against any NATO member as an attack against all. That commitment was approved by the Senate with a vote of 82-13. It has shaped American foreign policy for seventy-five years. Soldiers have deployed under its authority. Some have died under its flag.</p>\n\n<p>That treaty did not emerge from a resort in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>It was debated in the Senate. Witnesses testified. Amendments were proposed. The American people, through their elected representatives, decided whether this commitment was compatible with their security and their constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>The process was public. The vote was recorded. The obligation was clear.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We Are Watching</p>\n\n<p>What is being proposed now follows a different pattern.</p>\n\n<p>An executive commitment, negotiated privately, announced through press conferences, binding future administrations to obligations they did not approve and may not support. The Senate is not consulted. Treaties are not signed. Yet American credibility, and potentially American lives, are pledged.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time. It is the continuation of a shift that began decades ago.</p>\n\n<p>In 1973, President Nixon promised South Vietnam continued military support. Congress cut funding two years later. Saigon fell.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, the United States helped overthrow Libya's government without Congressional authorization, invoking an expansive interpretation of existing UN resolutions. The country remains fractured.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, President Obama declared that chemical weapons use in Syria would cross a \"red line.\" The line was crossed. No response followed. The commitment evaporated.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, the mechanism was the same: executive pronouncements treated as binding commitments, then abandoned or ignored when circumstances changed or political will shifted.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether any particular president is trustworthy. The question is whether commitments made without constitutional process are commitments at all.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Understood</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution vests the power to declare war in Congress. It requires Senate approval for treaties by a two-thirds vote. These are not procedural formalities. They are structural protections against executive overreach.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that the power to commit the nation to war must be separated from the power to wage it. Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the president's authority as commander-in-chief \"would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces.\" The decision to deploy those forces in a binding commitment of collective defense was reserved to the legislative branch.</p>\n\n<p>This separation was not an accident. It was the lesson of history.</p>\n\n<p>Kings made alliances. Kings pledged support. Kings sent armies to honor commitments that subjects had not approved and could not escape. The Constitution was written to ensure that the American people, through their representatives, would decide which wars to fight and which commitments to honor.</p>\n\n<p>What we are watching is the quiet erosion of that principle.</p>\n\n<p>## The Mechanism of Evasion</p>\n\n<p>The word \"guarantee\" is being used carefully. It is not \"treaty.\" It is not \"alliance.\" It is not \"mutual defense.\" Those words trigger constitutional requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Instead we hear: partnership, framework, assurance, commitment. The language is deliberately vague. It suggests obligation without invoking process. It allows presidents to claim they have secured peace while avoiding the Senate vote that would test whether the commitment is real.</p>\n\n<p>This is not unique to Ukraine. It is the pattern of modern executive power.</p>\n\n<p>The Authorization for Use of Military Force, passed in 2001 to pursue those responsible for the September 11 attacks, has been used to justify military operations in at least nineteen countries. Presidents of both parties have invoked it. No new authorization has been sought. The war powers have effectively been transferred to the executive, constrained only by the willingness of Congress to defund operations after they begin.</p>\n\n<p>Security guarantees without Senate approval follow the same logic. They create facts on the ground. They generate expectations. They make it politically costly to reverse course. By the time Congress might object, the commitment is already operational.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how the Constitution distributes the war power.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Ukraine deserves support. The question is not whether peace in Europe serves American interests. Those are legitimate policy debates.</p>\n\n<p>The question is this: Can a president, acting alone, commit the United States to the defense of another nation?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then the treaty power is meaningless. If fifteen-year guarantees can be negotiated at Mar-a-Lago, then Senate ratification is a formality we have outgrown. If the credibility of the United States can be pledged in a press conference, then the constitutional process for making binding commitments is an anachronism.</p>\n\n<p>That answer would represent a fundamental change in our constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>It would mean that the decision to go to war, or to create conditions that make war likely, rests solely with whoever holds the executive office. It would mean that the check the Founders built into the system—the requirement that the people's representatives approve commitments that might cost American lives—has been bypassed.</p>\n\n<p>It would mean that the presidency has become what the Founders feared: a temporary kingship, constrained by elections but not by law.</p>\n\n<p>## What History Teaches</p>\n\n<p>Security guarantees made without constitutional process do not last. They collapse the moment political circumstances change. The commitments evaporate. The credibility is spent.</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum of 1994 offered security assurances to Ukraine in exchange for surrendering its nuclear weapons. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia signed. Twenty years later, Russia invaded. The assurances proved empty.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between that memorandum and a Senate-ratified treaty is not rhetorical. It is constitutional. Treaties bind. Assurances do not. The distinction is not legalistic hairsplitting. It is the difference between a commitment enforceable under American law and a promise that evaporates when convenient.</p>\n\n<p>If we are serious about supporting Ukraine, the path is clear: negotiate a treaty, present it to the Senate, let the American people decide through their representatives whether this commitment is one they are willing to honor. If two-thirds of the Senate agrees, the commitment is real. If not, then we know the answer.</p>\n\n<p>What we are watching instead is the simulation of commitment without its substance.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath did not include a carve-out for foreign policy. It did not exempt security guarantees. It did not allow me to decide which parts of the constitutional order were binding and which were obsolete.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether that oath still governs.</p>\n\n<p>If presidents can commit the nation to war without Senate approval, if security guarantees can be negotiated in private and announced as fait accompli, if the treaty power can be bypassed through creative language and executive determination, then the constitutional structure is no longer operative. It has been replaced by something else: a system where power is checked only by the next election, not by law.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the system the Founders designed.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers being discussed—fifteen years, fifty years—are less important than the process being avoided. The percentages quoted—ninety percent, ninety-five percent—are less significant than the vote not being taken.</p>\n\n<p>The Senate exists for moments like this. The treaty power exists to ensure that commitments of American blood and treasure are made deliberately, publicly, and with the consent of the governed. If that process can be circumvented whenever a president decides it is inconvenient, then it is not a constitutional requirement. It is a suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>And suggestions do not bind.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength. But strength without legitimacy is only power. And power without process is what we fought a revolution to escape.</p>",

      "headline": "When Covert Becomes Overt: The CIA Strike in Venezuela and the Erosion of Restraint",
      "content": "<p>The CIA conducted a drone strike on Venezuelan soil last week. The President of the United States publicly acknowledged it. The agency declined to comment. Congress was presumably notified under covert action statutes, but the American people learned about it from the president's own words to a radio host.</p>\n\n<p>That sequence should trouble you.</p>\n\n<p>Not because of what happened in Venezuela. Not because of policy toward Maduro's narco-state. But because of what it reveals about how war powers now operate in this country.</p>\n\n<p>I served long enough to know that intelligence operations require secrecy. Covert action exists for good reason: some threats cannot be addressed through diplomacy or open military force. The National Security Act of 1947 established the CIA precisely because some missions require deniability. Congress codified oversight mechanisms after the Church Committee because covert action, by its nature, carries extraordinary risks.</p>\n\n<p>But something has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>The President is using the CIA to conduct what are effectively military strikes, then discussing them in media appearances. He confirmed in October that he had authorized CIA covert operations in Venezuela. Then he referenced specific strikes. Then he declined to specify whether the latest operation was CIA or military, while officials confirmed to reporters that it was indeed the agency.</p>\n\n<p>This is not covert action as the framework contemplates it. This is the use of intelligence authorities to accomplish military objectives while avoiding the restraints that apply to military operations.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Restraint</p>\n\n<p>When the military conducts strikes on foreign soil, certain mechanisms engage. The War Powers Resolution requires notification to Congress within 48 hours. The Authorization for Use of Military Force, however interpreted or abused, must be invoked. Military lawyers apply the law of armed conflict. Records are created. Chain of command is clear. Years later, historians can trace decisions.</p>\n\n<p>When the CIA acts covertly, different rules apply. The President must issue a formal \"finding\" under 50 U.S.C. § 3093. The Gang of Eight, leaders of the intelligence committees, must be notified. But the operations themselves remain classified. No public record exists. No debate occurs. The American people learn only what the administration chooses to disclose, if anything.</p>\n\n<p>The system assumes these will be different kinds of operations.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when they become the same operation, conducted under different authorities?</p>\n\n<p>That is not a hypothetical question. That is what we are watching.</p>\n\n<p>## The Venezuelan Escalation</p>\n\n<p>The administration has been conducting a months-long pressure campaign against Venezuela. It began with a Caribbean buildup in August. Thirty military strikes on alleged drug boats followed. Then came tanker seizures. Now, a strike on Venezuelan land, the first since this campaign began.</p>\n\n<p>Each step moves the line. Each step establishes a new baseline of normal. And by routing this latest strike through the CIA rather than Special Operations Command, the administration avoids certain reporting requirements that would apply to military action while still discussing the operation publicly enough to send a message.</p>\n\n<p>That message is heard in Caracas. But it should also be heard in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Maduro runs a criminal regime. He does. The question is not whether Venezuela poses challenges for U.S. interests. It does. The question is whether the President may conduct what amounts to a sustained military campaign using intelligence authorities to sidestep the mechanisms that Congress established to constrain executive war powers.</p>\n\n<p>I know what the answer is supposed to be. I am watching something different happen.</p>\n\n<p>## What Gets Normalized</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, Congress passed an AUMF targeting those responsible for 9/11. Three presidential administrations stretched that authorization to cover groups that did not exist in 2001, in countries Congress never mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>That expansion happened gradually. Each strike was justified by the one before. Each target was described as sufficiently connected to the original authorization. And over time, what was meant to be a specific response to a specific attack became a general grant of authority to strike threats wherever the executive identified them.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching a similar process with covert action authorities. What was meant for operations requiring deniability is being used for operations the President discusses on talk radio. What was meant for intelligence collection and limited paramilitary action is being used for sustained military campaigns. And what was meant to be subject to specific oversight is being routed through mechanisms that allow less scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>The CIA is not supposed to be a parallel military for hire. The intelligence committees are not supposed to substitute for the Armed Services Committees' oversight of military operations. And the President is not supposed to be able to wage war by choosing which statutory framework creates the least friction.</p>\n\n<p>But if you can achieve the same objective through intelligence authorities that you could through military action, and intelligence authorities require less notification, less documentation, and less public scrutiny, why would any president choose the more constrained path?</p>\n\n<p>The incentive structure now favors using covert action authorities for overt purposes.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question Congress Is Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>Congressional leaders were presumably briefed on this operation. The Gang of Eight was notified as required by law. But the rest of Congress, and the American people, know only what was publicly disclosed.</p>\n\n<p>That is the system working as designed for genuine covert action.</p>\n\n<p>It is not the system working as designed for sustained military pressure campaigns that the President discusses in media appearances.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what Congress should be asking: If the President is comfortable enough with an operation to reference it publicly, should that operation be conducted under authorities designed for actions that must remain secret?</p>\n\n<p>The covert action statute does not prohibit the President from later acknowledging operations. But it assumes that operations will generally remain classified, and that public acknowledgment will be the exception, not the pattern. It assumes that intelligence operations will be intelligence operations, not substitutes for military campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>When those assumptions break down, the statutory framework stops functioning as intended. The restraints Congress imposed become suggestions. And the difference between war powers subject to legislative oversight and executive action requiring only notification to eight members begins to collapse.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent</p>\n\n<p>This matters beyond Venezuela. It matters beyond this administration. Because what is established here will be available to every future president.</p>\n\n<p>If intelligence authorities can be used for sustained campaigns against nation-states, then the next president facing a crisis will remember that option. If operations can be discussed publicly while still remaining formally covert, then the distinction between acknowledged military action and deniable intelligence operations loses meaning. And if Congress accepts this expansion without clarifying the limits, then those limits effectively no longer exist.</p>\n\n<p>The tools we create for extraordinary circumstances become the tools we use for ordinary ones. The authorities we grant for this threat become the authorities invoked for the next. And the restraints we erode today are the restraints our children will wish existed when they inherit these powers in different hands.</p>\n\n<p>I have watched this process before. After 9/11, after the AUMF expansion, after drones became routine in Pakistan and Yemen and Somalia. Each time, the argument was that circumstances required flexibility. Each time, the promise was that authorities would be used responsibly. Each time, the expectation was that restraint would persist through norms if not through law.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, the restraints eroded anyway.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Constitution Anticipated</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the power to declare war. Article II makes the President Commander in Chief. The Founders created tension between those powers deliberately, believing that the decision to use force should require both branches to act.</p>\n\n<p>The intelligence apparatus was created later, after World War II, when the nature of conflict changed and new threats required new tools. But the fundamental structure remained: the decision to commit the nation to sustained military action should not rest with one person.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is the development of a workaround. If military action requires too much congressional involvement, use intelligence authorities instead. If the War Powers Resolution constrains one path, take another. If oversight is friction, choose the framework that generates less.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution's architecture of restraint only works if we maintain the distinction between different kinds of power. When those distinctions blur, when authorities meant for one purpose are used for another, the restraints fail.</p>\n\n<p>Not through defiance. Through adaptation.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Demand</p>\n\n<p>You do not need to oppose operations against drug traffickers to ask whether the legal framework governing those operations remains sound. You do not need to defend Maduro to ask whether the President should be able to wage undeclared war using intelligence authorities. You do not need to be a pacifist to believe that the decision to use force on foreign soil should be subject to meaningful democratic oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Those questions are not partisan. They are constitutional.</p>\n\n<p>If Congress believes the Venezuela campaign is justified, it should authorize it through military authorities. If the campaign requires secrecy, it should remain covert and unacknowledged. But the current approach, publicly discussed operations conducted through secret authorities, serves no legitimate purpose except to avoid the oversight mechanisms that would otherwise apply.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a constitutional republic should function. That is how restraints disappear while everyone is watching but no one is objecting.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether you support this operation. The test is whether you believe the next president, the one whose judgment you do not trust, should inherit these authorities in this form.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then the time to clarify the limits is now. Before the practice becomes precedent. Before the exception becomes the rule. Before temporary flexibility becomes permanent power.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders did not trust any individual with unconstrained war powers. They built a system that required Congress and the Executive to both participate in decisions to use force.

      "content": "<p>I spent years handling classified material. Not as a policy matter or a legal theory, but as someone who carried documents in locked cases, who understood that certain information, once disclosed, could cost lives. I learned that accountability isn't abstract. It's the difference between order and chaos, between a system that constrains power and one that merely justifies it.</p>\n\n<p>Jack Smith sat before the House Judiciary Committee on December 17th and made a statement that should be unremarkable but has become extraordinary: \"The Jan. 6 riot does not happen without Donald Trump.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not a political claim. This is prosecutorial judgment, offered under oath, about causation and culpability.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this moment significant is not what Smith said, but what happened next. The cases were abandoned. Not because the evidence failed. Not because a jury acquitted. Because the subject of the investigation won an election, and Justice Department policy prohibits indicting a sitting president.</p>\n\n<p>That policy is defensible. What is less defensible is what it reveals about how we now understand accountability.</p>\n\n<p>## The Prosecutor Who Could Not Prosecute</p>\n\n<p>Smith laid out his evidence in the deposition. He described Trump as \"the most culpable and most responsible person\" in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. He detailed how the case was built on testimony from Republicans who chose country over party, including a Pennsylvania elector who called the scheme \"an attempt to overthrow the government and illegal.\" He noted that Trump \"caused\" the Capitol attack, \"exploited it,\" and that it was \"foreseeable to him.\"</p>\n\n<p>He also described what Trump did while the violence unfolded: refused to stop it, issued a tweet that \"without question in my mind endangered the life of his own vice president,\" and had to be \"pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not hearsay. This is the assessment of a veteran prosecutor who reviewed the evidence, obtained cooperating witnesses, and presented the case to a grand jury that returned an indictment.</p>\n\n<p>Then Trump won the election. The cases ended.</p>\n\n<p>Not because the facts changed. Because the defendant's status changed.</p>\n\n<p>## What Has Quietly Shifted</p>\n\n<p>The principle that a sitting president cannot be indicted is longstanding. It rests on the idea that prosecuting a president while in office would interfere with the executive function. The remedy for presidential misconduct, in this framework, is impeachment, not indictment.</p>\n\n<p>But impeachment requires political will. It requires a Congress willing to place constitutional duty above partisan loyalty. What happens when that will does not exist? What happens when impeachment becomes a partisan exercise, acquittal a foregone conclusion, and the only remaining check is criminal prosecution after leaving office?</p>\n\n<p>What happens when a person can avoid that prosecution by winning another election?</p>\n\n<p>We are watching the collapse of the distinction between legal immunity and practical impunity.</p>\n\n<p>Legal immunity is temporary and bounded. It says: while you hold this office, you cannot be indicted, but you remain accountable through impeachment, and you remain subject to prosecution once you leave.</p>\n\n<p>Practical impunity is different. It says: if you can stay in power long enough, or regain power quickly enough, the law cannot reach you. The clock runs out. The cases are dismissed. The evidence is preserved in a transcript that becomes a historical footnote, not a judicial verdict.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Are Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>Smith was asked during his deposition whether his investigations were meant to prevent Trump from reclaiming the presidency. He bristled at the question, and rightly so. Prosecutors investigate crimes. Grand juries return indictments when they find probable cause. The timing of an investigation does not negate the validity of the charges.</p>\n\n<p>But here is the question we should be asking: What does it mean for the rule of law when the most serious charges against a former president can be nullified not by exoneration, but by election?</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Trump. This is about precedent.</p>\n\n<p>If a president can commit acts that a special counsel describes as criminal, if those acts can be detailed in an indictment, if cooperating witnesses can be found, if a grand jury can return charges, and if all of that can be rendered moot by winning another election, then we have created a new constitutional reality.</p>\n\n<p>We have created a category of person who is, in effect, above the law not because the law exempts them, but because the mechanisms of accountability have become too slow, too political, too easily gamed.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Feared</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 that impeachment was the remedy for \"offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\" He understood that such offenses were \"political\" in nature, meaning they related to the conduct of the state and the duties of office.</p>\n\n<p>But Hamilton also understood the danger of leaving such matters entirely to political bodies. He knew that \"the division of the government into distinct and separate departments\" was meant to prevent the concentration of power, and that each branch was meant to check the others.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when one branch will not check, and another cannot prosecute?</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist No. 51 that \"ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\" The system depends on each branch defending its prerogatives, on institutional jealousy preventing the accumulation of unchecked power.</p>\n\n<p>But what happens when ambition does not counteract ambition? What happens when one party controls both the executive and the legislative branch, and regards accountability as disloyalty?</p>\n\n<p>The system bends. The lines move. What was once extraordinary becomes routine.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing that Trump should have been convicted. I am not arguing that the evidence was dispositive, or that a jury would have reached a particular verdict. Those are questions for a courtroom, and we will never know the answers because the cases did not proceed.</p>\n\n<p>What I am arguing is this: We are normalizing a system in which the most serious allegations against a president can be investigated, indicted, and then abandoned not because they were disproven, but because the calendar ran out.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the rule of law. That is the rule of timing.</p>\n\n<p>Smith's testimony will be read by historians. It will be cited in law review articles. It may even be taught in classrooms as an example of prosecutorial judgment in politically charged cases. But it will not result in a verdict, because the defendant became unreachable.</p>\n\n<p>Is this compatible with a free society? Is this what the Founders intended when they created a system of checks and balances?</p>\n\n<p>Those questions, unanswered, define the test we face. Not whether Trump is guilty or innocent, but whether the system can hold anyone accountable when accountability depends on speed, on political will, and on an electorate that may or may not care.</p>\n\n<p>That test is here.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Taiwan's president stood before cameras after China's latest military drills and pledged to defend the island's sovereignty. The statement was expected. The drills were expected. The international response was expected.</p>\n\n<p>That's the problem.</p>\n\n<p>We have normalized what should be extraordinary. Large-scale military exercises encircling a democratic society of 23 million people have become routine enough that they merit brief news coverage before we move to the next story. The question isn't whether Taiwan's president will defend sovereignty. The question is whether the international order still recognizes sovereignty as something more than a performance.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in government watching how power moves when no one is watching the seams. You learn that the most dangerous shifts aren't sudden. They're incremental. They're the drills that happen every few months until they're happening every few weeks. They're the intrusions that cross a line until that line becomes the new baseline.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Taiwan alone. This is about whether territorial integrity means anything when backed only by statements rather than structure.</p>\n\n<p>**The Erosion We're Witnessing**</p>\n\n<p>The drills China conducts around Taiwan follow a pattern anyone who has studied military operations recognizes: normalization through repetition. Each exercise pushes slightly further. Each one lasts slightly longer. Each one involves slightly more sophisticated capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The goal isn't invasion today. The goal is making the possibility of invasion so routine that when it happens, the world responds with the same measured statements it's been issuing for years.</p>\n\n<p>This is how lines move. Not through dramatic declarations but through patient pressure.</p>\n\n<p>The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 commits the United States to provide Taiwan with defense articles and services. It states that any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than peaceful means would be \"of grave concern.\" But grave concern has become the international community's standard response to nearly everything. The phrase has been depleted of meaning through overuse.</p>\n\n<p>What we're watching is the slow strangulation of a principle—that borders cannot be changed by force—through the patient application of force that stops just short of war.</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Guarantees**</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan operates under strategic ambiguity. The United States has not explicitly guaranteed its defense. This ambiguity was meant to deter both Chinese aggression and Taiwanese declarations of formal independence. It was meant to preserve stability.</p>\n\n<p>But ambiguity only works when all parties believe certain lines still matter. When those lines are tested repeatedly without consequence, ambiguity becomes indistinguishability. It becomes unclear whether commitments exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>I've sat in rooms where officials debate what level of action would trigger response. The debates are earnest. The analysis is sophisticated. But the underlying question is never quite asked: At what point does our failure to enforce principles mean we no longer hold those principles?</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that power respects nothing but power. Hamilton wrote in Federalist 34 that nations must have \"an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they might arise.\" But he was writing about a nation's capacity to defend itself, not the international community's capacity to defend abstract principles while avoiding risk.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan can pledge to defend its sovereignty. That pledge means nothing without the capacity to make good on it, and small democracies facing large authoritarian neighbors rarely possess that capacity alone.</p>\n\n<p>**What Sovereignty Means**</p>\n\n<p>Sovereignty isn't a statement. It's a fact pattern. It's functioning institutions, territorial control, international recognition, and the capacity to defend all three. Taiwan has the first three. The fourth is what's being tested.</p>\n\n<p>The People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan. Not for a day. Taiwan has its own constitution, its own military, its own currency, its own democratically elected government. By any functional measure, Taiwan is sovereign.</p>\n\n<p>But sovereignty without security is sovereignty on loan. It lasts until someone stronger decides it shouldn't.</p>\n\n<p>This is the test we're failing to acknowledge. The question isn't whether Taiwan will defend itself. The question is whether the international order still believes that territorial integrity matters enough to impose costs on those who violate it before the violation is complete.</p>\n\n<p>**The Pattern We've Seen Before**</p>\n\n<p>Crimea was sovereign Ukrainian territory until Russian troops arrived and it wasn't. The international community condemned the action, imposed sanctions, and moved on. Crimea is still occupied.</p>\n\n<p>Georgia's breakaway regions were sovereign Georgian territory until Russian recognition and military support made them independent in everything but international law. The world objected. The regions remain separated.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is consistent: Test boundaries, face condemnation, absorb sanctions, retain gains. The cost-benefit analysis favors aggression when the costs are temporary and the benefits are permanent.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan sees this. That's why its president must pledge to defend sovereignty rather than assume it. That's why the island spends over two percent of GDP on defense despite having an economy built on trade and technology, not military power. That's why every military drill from Beijing sends not just a message but a measurement: How much will they prepare? How much will their partners commit?</p>\n\n<p>**The American Question**</p>\n\n<p>The United States faces a version of the question the Founders debated: How do you preserve liberty against power without becoming the thing you oppose? How do you maintain order without maintaining empire?</p>\n\n<p>We have interests in Taiwan's continued autonomy. Economic interests—the island produces the advanced semiconductors that run modern economies. Strategic interests—Taiwan sits at a geographic chokepoint for Pacific trade. Moral interests—23 million people living in a democracy should not be absorbed into an authoritarian state against their will.</p>\n\n<p>But interests are not commitments, and in the ambiguity between the two, Taiwan lives in permanent uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know whether the United States should explicitly guarantee Taiwan's defense. That decision involves calculations above my rank. But I know what happens when commitments are ambiguous and adversaries are patient. I know what happens when we treat sovereignty as a principle we honor in rhetoric but not in risk.</p>\n\n<p>We get more drills. More intrusions. More normalization of what should be extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Until one day it isn't a drill.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question we're not asking is this: What makes sovereignty real?</p>\n\n<p>Is it international recognition? Taiwan doesn't have that—most nations maintain only informal ties to avoid angering Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>Is it functional independence? Taiwan has that, but function without security is temporary.</p>\n\n<p>Is it the will to defend? Taiwan has that too, but will without capacity is performance.</p>\n\n<p>Is it external guarantees? Taiwan has strategic ambiguity, which might mean support or might mean statements.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is probably all of the above, functioning together. Remove any piece and the structure weakens. Remove enough pieces and sovereignty becomes something leaders pledge to defend because it can no longer be assumed.</p>\n\n<p>That's where Taiwan is. That's where we've let it arrive through incremental acceptance of what should be unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>When military drills encircling a democracy become routine. When we measure our response in careful statements rather than committed action. When sovereignty requires daily defense rather than assumed respect.</p>\n\n<p>We're not just failing Taiwan. We're failing the principle that borders exist, that territorial integrity matters, that might doesn't make right when right has no might behind it.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't in Taiwan's pledge to defend its sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>The test is whether the rest of us still believe sovereignty means anything worth defending.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in places where coalitions held together not from shared principles but from shared enemies. When the enemy recedes, the coalition's real nature becomes visible. What happens next tests whether the arrangement was ever about governance or merely about power.</p>\n\n<p>Yemen is teaching that lesson again.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We've Seen Before</p>\n\n<p>The Southern Transitional Council announced a constitution for an independent South Yemen on January 2, 2026. That's not a declaration of independence in the way Americans understand the term—not a statement of grievances followed by an assertion of natural rights. It's a unilateral claim to authority backed by force, announced while Saudi warplanes strike STC positions and UAE support flows to the separatists.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't governance. This is partition by violence under the rhetoric of self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>The international community has spent a decade pretending the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen was unified in purpose: restore the internationally recognized government, defeat the Iranian-backed Houthis, stabilize the country. That coalition is now bombing itself. Saudi Arabia strikes UAE-backed forces. The government it claimed to restore has fled to Riyadh. The Presidential Palace in Aden, which coalition forces supposedly secured, is controlled by separatists who reject that government's authority entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The pretense has collapsed.</p>\n\n<p>## What a Constitution Actually Requires</p>\n\n<p>The STC calls its document a \"constitution.\" It has 30 articles. It proclaims \"the State of South Arabia.\" It promises a referendum in two years on self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>But a constitution is not merely a document asserting authority. It is a framework that derives legitimacy from the consent of the governed, implemented through processes that create accountability rather than merely consolidating control.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison, in Federalist 51, wrote that \"the structure of the government must furnish the proper checks and balances between the different departments.\" The STC's \"constitution\" appears to furnish nothing but an assertion of territorial control by forces that seized two provinces by arms last month and now demand other factions accept their claim.</p>\n\n<p>That's not constitutionalism. That's conquest with paperwork.</p>\n\n<p>The test of a constitutional order is whether it constrains power or merely justifies it. Whether it creates mechanisms for peaceful resolution of disputes or demands submission under threat of force. Whether temporary authority remains temporary or becomes permanent through the logic of emergency.</p>\n\n<p>The STC's \"constitution\" appears designed to do the opposite: to present a unilateral seizure of territory as a legitimate constitutional act, to frame military control as self-determination, to make provisional what should require deliberation and consent.</p>\n\n<p>## When Imposed Order Reveals Its Nature</p>\n\n<p>For ten years, the international community treated the Saudi-led coalition as a legitimate governing authority in Yemen. The United States provided intelligence, refueling, targeting assistance. The coalition's intervention was framed as restoring order, protecting regional stability, countering Iranian expansion.</p>\n\n<p>That intervention has killed tens of thousands of civilians. It has produced what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. It has destroyed infrastructure, blockaded ports, and created conditions for famine and disease. And now the coalition that justified all of this as necessary for Yemen's stability is fracturing into open conflict between its major backers.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an aberration. This is the nature of imposed order revealing itself when the justifying emergency no longer holds the arrangement together.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia now bombs positions it once funded. The UAE supports forces that reject the government it once claimed to restore. Forces that fought together against the Houthis now fight each other for control of the south. The internationally recognized government exists in exile, recognized internationally but governing nothing.</p>\n\n<p>And through it all, the Houthis still control the north.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson isn't that intervention always fails. The lesson is that intervention justified by temporary emergency tends to become permanent, that coalitions built on shared enemies rather than shared principles fracture when the enemy recedes, and that the pretense of legitimacy eventually collapses under the weight of what was done in its name.</p>\n\n<p>## The Questions Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>When a faction announces a constitution while under bombardment by its former allies, several questions become relevant:</p>\n\n<p>Was the coalition ever about the principles it claimed, or was it always about competing regional powers using Yemen as a proxy battlefield?</p>\n\n<p>If the internationally recognized government was the coalition's goal, why does that government now exist only in exile while coalition members fight each other for control?</p>\n\n<p>If stability was the objective, what has been achieved after ten years of intervention except the fragmentation of the country into competing spheres of influence, each backed by a different external power?</p>\n\n<p>If humanitarian protection justified the intervention, how do we account for the humanitarian catastrophe the intervention produced?</p>\n\n<p>And most importantly: when does temporary authority imposed by emergency become indistinguishable from permanent rule justified by necessity?</p>\n\n<p>These questions matter beyond Yemen. They matter every time intervention is justified by temporary emergency, every time coalition unity is asserted without examining what holds it together, every time constitutional language is deployed to legitimize what force has already decided.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals About Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>The STC's \"constitution\" will likely be dismissed by the international community as illegitimate because it was announced unilaterally, without consultation, backed by force rather than consent. That dismissal will be correct.</p>\n\n<p>But the same standard should apply to the arrangement that preceded it: a coalition justified by restoring a government that never controlled the territory it claimed, backed by powers whose actual interests diverged from their stated principles, maintained through a decade of violence that achieved none of its stated objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy cannot be asserted by proclamation, whether that proclamation comes from separatists announcing a constitution or from coalitions announcing their mission is stability while bombing hospitals.</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy requires consent, accountability, mechanisms for peaceful change, and limits on power that bind those who wield it. The STC's document appears to provide none of those. Neither did the arrangement it seeks to replace.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a justification for the STC's actions. It's an observation about what happens when temporary authority imposed by force becomes the normal condition, when constitutional language is used to justify what violence has decided, when the test of legitimacy becomes which faction the international community chooses to recognize rather than whether any party has demonstrated accountability to the people they claim to govern.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test That Remains</p>\n\n<p>Yemen's fracture is not unique. It follows a pattern visible in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan—places where intervention was justified by temporary emergency, where imposed order was presented as necessary for stability, where coalitions held together through shared enemies rather than shared principles.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, the pretense eventually collapsed. The emergency never ended. The temporary authority became permanent. The coalition fractured. And the people who lived there paid the price for arrangements made in their name by powers whose interests lay elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't whether to intervene. The test is whether intervention creates or merely displaces violence, whether temporary authority remains temporary or becomes permanent, whether constitutional forms constrain power or merely justify it.</p>\n\n<p>Yemen is failing that test. Again.</p>\n\n<p>The question American citizens should ask is not which faction to support in Yemen's civil war. The question is whether the pattern that produced this outcome—intervention justified by temporary emergency, coalition unity asserted without examining what sustains it, constitutional language deployed to legitimize what force decides—is compatible with the principles we claim to hold.</p>\n\n<p>Not just in Yemen.</p>\n\n<p>Everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered honestly, is why this still matters.</p>",

It is not even regime change in the post-9/11 sense.</p>\n\n<p>It is direct administration of foreign territory by executive decree.</p>\n\n<p>## What Authority, Exactly?</p>\n\n<p>The Chevron license to operate in Venezuela was granted by the Biden administration in 2022 under existing sanctions law. It required Treasury Department approval, State Department coordination, and operated within a legal framework established over years of congressional and executive action.</p>\n\n<p>That is how the system is supposed to work. Incrementally. With legal predicates. With checks.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have moved from \"American companies may operate in Venezuela under license\" to \"American companies will run Venezuela's oil infrastructure and the United States will run the country.\"</p>\n\n<p>What statute authorizes this? What appropriation funds it? What congressional resolution blesses it? What body of international law permits one nation to announce it will \"run\" another?</p>\n\n<p>The answer appears to be: none.</p>\n\n<p>The authority is presidential will. The justification is that Maduro was a dictator and his successor is not yet in place. The mechanism is announcement.</p>\n\n<p>This is how extraordinary measures become normalized. Not through dramatic constitutional crisis. Through vocabulary that slips past the ear. Through policy declared rather than debated. Through the quiet substitution of executive decree for legal process.</p>\n\n<p>## The Decade We Are Not Discussing</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela's oil infrastructure, we are told, will take tens of billions of dollars and potentially a decade to restore. Even former BP executives acknowledge that output might actually fall during reorganization. The former chief executive of BP called it \"a very long term project.\"</p>\n\n<p>A decade is longer than World War II lasted. A decade is longer than the initial reconstruction of Japan under MacArthur. A decade is longer than the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the entirety of the Johnson administration combined.</p>\n\n<p>If we are going to \"run\" Venezuela for a decade, what does that mean?</p>\n\n<p>Who governs? Under what legal authority? With what accountability to Congress, to international law, to the Venezuelan people themselves? Who pays? For how long? With what recourse if companies expropriate assets, if corruption persists, if the \"safe transition\" never materializes?</p>\n\n<p>These are not rhetorical questions. They are constitutional requirements.</p>\n\n<p>When the United States occupied Japan and Germany after World War II, it did so under military authority following declared war, unconditional surrender, and explicit congressional appropriations for reconstruction. The occupation had defined legal status, multilateral oversight, and clear end conditions.</p>\n\n<p>When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, Congress authorized military force. A Coalition Provisional Authority was established by executive order with defined powers and duration. When that authority transferred to Iraqi sovereignty in 2004, it did so under UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements.</p>\n\n<p>Those precedents had problems. They generated controversy. They cost blood and treasure. But they operated within some framework of law.</p>\n\n<p>What framework applies here?</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>American oil companies may well be reluctant to invest tens of billions in a country whose government expropriated ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips assets in the 2000s. They may well doubt the stability of whatever government emerges. They may well calculate that the risk exceeds the reward, no matter how large the proven reserves.</p>\n\n<p>But the deeper question is not whether they will invest. The deeper question is under what authority they would be operating if they do.</p>\n\n<p>If Venezuela's successor government invites American companies to develop oil infrastructure under negotiated contracts, that is sovereignty in action. That is how nations rebuild after dictatorship. It may succeed or fail based on the terms negotiated, the governance established, the trust rebuilt.</p>\n\n<p>If American companies operate under the authority of the United States government while the United States government \"runs\" Venezuela, that is something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>That is a trust territory without treaty. An occupation without declaration. A protectorate without legal standing.</p>\n\n<p>The word for that used to be \"colony.\"</p>\n\n<p>## The Principle at Stake</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing that America should abandon Venezuela to chaos. I am not arguing that Maduro's removal was unjust. I am not arguing that Venezuelan oil should never flow again.</p>\n\n<p>I am arguing that the process matters. That the authority matters. That the difference between \"we will help Venezuela rebuild\" and \"we will run Venezuela\" is not semantic.</p>\n\n<p>It is constitutional.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned in Federalist No. 41: \"The powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as little formidable to those reserved to the individual States, as they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Union.\" The same principle applies to executive power in foreign affairs. The authority must be proportional, defined, and accountable.</p>\n\n<p>When a president can announce that America will \"run\" another country without congressional authorization, without legal framework, without defined limits or end conditions, we have moved beyond the constitutional order that constrains power.</p>\n\n<p>We have moved into something else.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Normalizes</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time extraordinary executive authority has been asserted in foreign affairs. It will not be the last. But each instance that passes without constitutional check becomes precedent for the next.</p>\n\n<p>If we can \"run\" Venezuela by executive decree, can we \"run\" Haiti? Cuba? Any nation where crisis offers opportunity and oil offers incentive?</p>\n\n<p>The principle, once established, does not limit itself to convenient cases.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War and later wrote: \"Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?\" He was arguing that extreme crisis justified extreme measures. But he was also acknowledging that those measures were violations. That they required justification beyond presidential will.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction, between emergency action later justified and permanent authority casually claimed, is what this moment is erasing.</p>\n\n<p>The United States will \"run\" Venezuela. The statement was made. No law was cited. No constitutional mechanism engaged. No congressional debate held. No treaty signed.</p>\n\n<p>Just policy. By announcement.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether that is compatible with a republic.</p>\n\n<p>Not whether it is expedient. Not whether it might work. Not whether Maduro deserved removal.</p>\n\n<p>Whether a president announcing that America will \"run\" another sovereign nation, for however long it takes, under whatever authority he asserts, is the kind of power the Constitution permits.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years carrying a security clearance. I briefed alliance partners. I knew what NATO Article 5 meant, what mutual defense obligations looked like on paper and in practice.</p>\n\n<p>So I know what it means when the President of the United States publicly discusses annexing the territory of a NATO ally.</p>\n\n<p>It means something has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Greenland's strategic value. The United States already has substantial military access to Greenland under existing agreements with Denmark. Thule Air Base has operated there since 1951. We have what we need for national security through lawful cooperation with a democratic ally.</p>\n\n<p>This is about something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>## The Language of Acquisition</p>\n\n<p>Listen to the words being used. Not \"negotiate,\" not \"partner,\" not \"cooperate.\"</p>\n\n<p>Annex.</p>\n\n<p>That's the language of territorial conquest. That's what Russia said about Crimea in 2014. That's what imperial powers said in the 19th century when they drew lines on maps and called it diplomacy.</p>\n\n<p>The President has \"refused to rule out\" using force. A senior aide's spouse posts a map of Greenland colored as an American flag with the caption \"SOON.\" The administration appoints a special envoy to Greenland, bypassing Denmark's foreign ministry entirely.</p>\n\n<p>These are not normal diplomatic overtures. These are the actions of a power that sees sovereignty as conditional, treaties as suggestions, and allied territory as potentially available.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark's Prime Minister had to remind the United States that they are covered by NATO's security guarantee. Think about that sentence. A NATO ally had to publicly invoke Article 5, not against an external threat, but as a warning to the United States itself.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>This comes days after a military operation that seized Venezuela's president. The President then announced the United States would \"run\" Venezuela and that American oil companies would \"start making money for the country.\"</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is clear. What is being normalized is the idea that American power can simply override sovereignty when we determine we have strategic interests.</p>\n\n<p>Greenland has mineral wealth we want. It has strategic position we value. Therefore, the logic goes, we should control it.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that 57,000 people live there, that they have their own government, that they overwhelmingly oppose becoming American territory, that they are citizens of a democratic nation with which we have treaty obligations, these are treated as obstacles, not as fundamental realities that define the limits of legitimate action.</p>\n\n<p>I remember when we used to criticize other nations for thinking this way.</p>\n\n<p>## What Alliances Mean</p>\n\n<p>I deployed alongside NATO partners. I saw what mutual defense looks like when it's real. It means you don't covet your ally's territory. It means you don't publicly discuss annexing land that belongs to a democratic partner. It means you don't send signals that their sovereignty is negotiable if we decide we want what they have.</p>\n\n<p>Article 5 of the NATO Treaty states that an armed attack against one member \"shall be considered an attack against them all.\" We invoked that article once, after September 11th. NATO allies deployed to Afghanistan. Danish soldiers died there, alongside Americans, under that mutual defense obligation.</p>\n\n<p>Now their Prime Minister has to publicly state that Denmark expects respect for its territorial integrity. From us.</p>\n\n<p>If American territorial ambitions can override the sovereignty of a NATO ally, what does NATO mean? If our security interests justify annexation, what principle restrains any other power from making the same claim?</p>\n\n<p>The answer being offered is: American power restrains other powers. We can do what they cannot because we are stronger.</p>\n\n<p>That's not an alliance system. That's a protection racket.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war and to regulate relations with foreign nations. The President commands the military, but does not possess inherent authority to annex foreign territory or override treaty obligations.</p>\n\n<p>Yet we are watching this play out as if it were purely an executive matter. No congressional authorization is being sought. No debate about whether acquiring Greenland, by whatever means, serves the national interest or comports with our treaty obligations.</p>\n\n<p>The assumption is that if the President wants it, if he can describe a security rationale, then the question is merely tactical: how, not whether.</p>\n\n<p>This is how executive power expands. Not through formal amendment, but through the gradual acceptance that some objectives, if deemed important enough, simply happen outside the normal constitutional process.</p>\n\n<p>First, we accept that national security justifies extraordinary action.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we accept that the President defines what national security requires.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we accept that allies' sovereignty is subordinate to our security needs.</p>\n\n<p>At no point does Congress formally cede this authority. It simply fails to assert it.</p>\n\n<p>## What History Shows</p>\n\n<p>In 1846, the United States went to war with Mexico, seized vast territory, and later paid $15 million in what was framed as a purchase but followed military conquest. That expansion was contentious even then. Abraham Lincoln, then a congressman, challenged President Polk to identify the exact spot where American blood had been shed to justify the war.</p>\n\n<p>The question Lincoln was asking was whether the conflict served legitimate defense or disguised territorial ambition.</p>\n\n<p>We should ask that question now. Does the United States face a genuine security threat that existing agreements with Denmark cannot address? Or are we describing ambition as necessity?</p>\n\n<p>Greenland's people have the same right to self-determination that we claimed in 1776. They are not resources to be acquired. They are citizens of a democratic nation, entitled to decide their own future.</p>\n\n<p>When we stop recognizing that, when we start speaking of allied territory as something we \"need\" and therefore might take, we have left behind the principles that made us different from the empires we once opposed.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test of Principle</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether Greenland has strategic value. It does.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether the Arctic matters. It does.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether we recognize limits to our power, whether we honor treaty obligations, whether we respect the sovereignty of democratic allies, and whether the Constitution constrains how we pursue even legitimate interests.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the answer emerging is that when the President invokes national security, those constraints fade.</p>\n\n<p>No treaty is absolute. No sovereignty is secure. No alliance removes American territory from consideration if we decide we want it.</p>\n\n<p>That's not American exceptionalism. That's just imperialism with better public relations.</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. So did the President. That oath doesn't include an exception for strategically located islands. It doesn't authorize annexing allied territory because we've decided it serves our interests.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether Greenland matters strategically.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the law still restrains us when we want something.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, watching this unfold, I'm not sure we know the answer anymore.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I never imagined that oath might require defending our NATO allies from us.</p>\n\n<p>The White House has confirmed that the President is considering military options to acquire Greenland, a territory of Denmark. Denmark is not an adversary. Denmark is a NATO ally. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. We wrote that treaty. We founded that alliance. Now we are discussing whether to use military force against a member state.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Greenland's strategic value. It's about what we're willing to become.</p>\n\n<p>The language matters. The White House called acquiring Greenland \"a national security priority\" and confirmed that \"utilizing the US military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal.\" The phrasing is precise. It does not say the military is an option if Greenland becomes a threat. It says the military is an option to pursue what we want.</p>\n\n<p>That's not defense. That's conquest.</p>\n\n<p>A senior adviser to the President, when asked if force would be ruled out, replied: \"Nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\" Think about what that sentence assumes. It assumes that superior military power justifies territorial ambition. It assumes that might makes right. It assumes that an ally's refusal to sell its territory is irrelevant if we decide we need it.</p>\n\n<p>Every autocrat in history has made that calculation.</p>\n\n<p>## The Treaty We Signed</p>\n\n<p>Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution grants the President power to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate. The North Atlantic Treaty was ratified by the Senate on July 21, 1949, by a vote of 82 to 13. It entered into force on August 24, 1949. It is binding law under Article VI of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>Article 1 of the North Atlantic Treaty commits signatories to \"settle any international dispute in which they may be involved by peaceful means\" and to \"refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force.\"</p>\n\n<p>Article 5 states: \"The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.\"</p>\n\n<p>Denmark is a party to that treaty. So are we. The treaty does not contain an exception for when we decide we want something. It does not say that Article 5 applies only when convenient. It says an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>\n\n<p>If we use military force against Denmark, we violate the treaty we signed. We commit the armed attack that Article 5 was written to prevent. We become the threat NATO was created to counter.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark's Prime Minister stated that an American attack would spell the end of NATO. She is not exaggerating. If the guarantor of collective defense becomes the aggressor, the alliance ceases to exist. Not formally, perhaps. But functionally. What ally will trust Article 5 if we demonstrate that our word is conditional on our ambitions?</p>\n\n<p>## The People Being Claimed</p>\n\n<p>Greenland is not empty land. It is home to 57,000 people, the majority of them Indigenous Greenlanders, the Kalaallit. The territory has had self-government since 1979. Opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Morgan Angaju, an Inuit from Ilulissat, told reporters it is \"terrifying to listen to the leader of the free world laughing at Denmark and Greenland and just talking about us like we're something to claim.\" He added: \"We are already claimed by the Greenlandic people. Kalaallit Nunaat means the land of the Greenlandic people.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Greenlanders are not asking to join us. They are protesting the idea. A thousand of them marched in March 2025 carrying signs reading \"Kalaallit don't want to be annexed\" and \"Greenland belongs to Inuit.\" They are not consulted in this \"national security priority.\" They are referred to as if they are incidental to the real estate.</p>\n\n<p>This is not negotiation. This is discussing the future of a people without their consent.</p>\n\n<p>The Declaration of Independence states that governments derive \"their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" Lincoln, in his First Inaugural Address, said: \"No state, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union, that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\"</p>\n\n<p>He was speaking of secession, but the principle holds. A government cannot simply seize territory and impose its authority because it declares that doing so serves its interests. The people living there have a claim. International law recognizes this. The UN Charter, which the United States signed and the Senate ratified, upholds \"the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.\"</p>\n\n<p>Seven European nations issued a joint statement affirming that \"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations.\" That principle is not a diplomatic nicety. It is the foundation of the international order we built after World War II to prevent exactly this kind of territorial ambition.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization of Force</p>\n\n<p>What alarms me most is the casual tone. The White House statement was matter-of-fact. The senior adviser was dismissive. There was no acknowledgment that what is being discussed, military action against an ally over territory it will not sell, is extraordinary. It was framed as ordinary. As an option on the table. As something within normal bounds.</p>\n\n<p>This is how norms collapse. Not with a sudden rupture, but with a steady redefinition of what is reasonable. If using military force to acquire the territory of an ally can be publicly discussed by the White House as an option under consideration, then the line has already moved. What was unthinkable is now thinkable. What was beyond the pale is now a policy choice.</p>\n\n<p>We saw this pattern before. Extraordinary rendition, once exposed, was defended as necessary. Enhanced interrogation, once revealed, was justified as effective. Drone strikes in nations we are not at war with, once controversial, became routine. Each time, the argument was: the threat is real, the stakes are high, the President has the authority, the critics don't understand the danger.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, temporary measures became permanent. Each time, legal boundaries were reinterpreted. Each time, what had been forbidden became policy.</p>\n\n<p>The framing of Greenland as a national security priority follows that pattern. It is not presented as a desire or an ambition. It is presented as a necessity. Once something is framed as necessary for national security, dissent becomes suspect. Legal constraints become obstacles. Allied objections become irritants.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Greenland has strategic value. The question is whether that value justifies what we are willing to do to obtain it.</p>\n\n<p>## What Comes Next</p>\n\n<p>I keep thinking about Morgan Angaju's fear that Greenland's prime minister might \"suffer the same fate as Maduro.\" That fear is not paranoia. It is a reasonable inference from the facts. The U.S. military seized the president of Venezuela, a sovereign nation, and brought him to the United States to face criminal charges. Days later, a senior White House adviser posted a map of Greenland with the American flag and the word \"SOON.\"</p>\n\n<p>The message is clear. If we want something, and you do not give it to us, we will take it. The method may vary. Economic pressure. Political coercion. Military force. But the result is the same.</p>\n\n<p>This is not how republics behave. This is how empires behave.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war. It does not grant the President the power to declare territorial ambitions and pursue them by any means necessary. The Founders were explicit about this. They had seen monarchy. They had seen executives who treated their own judgment as law. They designed a system where the decision to commit the nation to violence required the consent of the people's representatives.</p>\n\n<p>That constraint exists for a reason. It exists because power, unchecked, expands. It exists because one person's certainty is dangerous. It exists because what seems necessary in the moment may prove catastrophic in hindsight.</p>\n\n<p>## What We Are Testing</p>\n\n<p>NATO has endured for 76 years because its members believed that collective defense was real. That if one was attacked, the others would respond. That the United States, as the alliance's most powerful member, would honor its commitments even when inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>If we violate that trust, if we demonstrate that our commitments are conditional on our desires, we do not merely weaken NATO. We eliminate the foundation of any alliance. Why would any nation trust our word if we are willing to use force against those we pledged to defend?</p>\n\n<p>The argument that \"nobody's going to fight the US\" is not reassuring. It is chilling. It suggests that the limiting principle on our actions is not law, not treaty, not principle, but merely whether others can resist us. That is the logic of domination, not of leadership.</p>\n\n<p>I served because I believed in something. I believed that we defended a constitutional order, that we honored treaties, that we respected the sovereignty of nations and the dignity of peoples. I believed that our power was legitimate because it was bounded by law.</p>\n\n<p>If we use military force to acquire Greenland, what do we become?</p>\n\n<p>Not a republic. An empire that calls itself one.</p>\n\n<p>Not an alliance leader. A hegemon that demands submission.</p>\n\n<p>Not a constitutional democracy. A system where executive ambition defines national interest and military force is merely an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal.</p>\n\n<p>The Greenlanders do not want this. The Danes do not want this. Our European allies have explicitly opposed this. The question is whether what we want overrides all of that.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is what defines this moment.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

Maritime safety standards. Aviation protocols. Disease surveillance networks. The kind of cooperation that keeps planes from colliding and pandemics from spreading undetected.</p>\n\n<p>Most Americans never think about these organizations. They exist in that vast architecture of international order built after 1945, when the United States decided that leading meant building systems, not just wielding power.</p>\n\n<p>Now we are withdrawing from sixty-six of them.</p>\n\n<p>Not renegotiating. Not reforming. Withdrawing.</p>\n\n<p>The executive order describes these bodies as \"redundant,\" \"mismanaged,\" \"captured by actors advancing agendas contrary to our own.\" It calls them threats to \"sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.\" The language is sweeping. The specifics matter less than the principle being asserted: that participation in international cooperation is now conditional on moment-to-moment alignment with executive preferences.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about saving money.

These organizations operate through voluntary cooperation on technical standards.</p>\n\n<p>This is about something else.</p>\n\n<p>What we are watching is the conversion of leadership into transaction. America participates when it serves immediate interests, withdraws when it doesn't.

They built a constitution that channeled authority through institutions, constrained it with procedures, made it predictable enough that other nations could deal with us as a republic of laws rather than a collection of temporary preferences.</p>\n\n<p>That principle extended outward after 1945. The international order we built, however imperfect, rested on American participation in forums where we didn't always get our way. The World Trade Organization. The International Monetary Fund. The United Nations itself. These weren't acts of charity. They were instruments of American leadership, ways of shaping global outcomes through systems rather than serial confrontations.</p>\n\n<p>Withdrawing doesn't make America sovereign. We were already sovereign. It makes America unpredictable. It signals that our participation in any international forum is provisional, subject to executive whim, liable to change with each administration.</p>\n\n<p>Other nations will draw conclusions. They will build systems that don't depend on American participation. They will make agreements that exclude us. They will solve problems without us, because they cannot count on us.</p>\n\n<p>That's not sovereignty. That's abdication.</p>\n\n<p>## What Gets Normalized</p>\n\n<p>The executive order frames withdrawal as housekeeping. These organizations are \"redundant,\" \"poorly run,\" aligned with \"woke\" agendas. The language makes it sound like budget cutting, efficiency, common sense.</p>\n\n<p>But look at what's on the list. The International Cotton Advisory Committee. The International Tropical Timber Organization. The Pan-American Institute for Geography and History. These are technical bodies. They coordinate standards, share data, prevent conflicts before they start.</p>\n\n<p>Withdrawing from them doesn't protect American sovereignty. It eliminates American influence in the forums where standards get set. When we're not at the table, others make the rules. When we withdraw from the International Telecommunications Union, China fills the space. When we leave the International Maritime Organization, shipping standards get written without American input.</p>\n\n<p>The deeper pattern is this: expertise is being treated as optional. The people who run these organizations, who understand their functions, who know what will break when we leave, they're not being consulted. The withdrawal is categorical, ideological, comprehensive.</p>\n\n<p>That should worry anyone who believes governing requires knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>It should especially worry anyone who remembers that international cooperation, however tedious, is how we prevent the kind of catastrophic miscalculations that lead to wider conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Authority</p>\n\n<p>Article II gives the President authority to conduct foreign relations. That's not in dispute. But the Senate ratifies treaties. Congress appropriates funds. The President doesn't have unilateral authority to remake American foreign policy through executive orders that repudiate decades of treaty commitments.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these withdrawals involve treaties that required Senate consent. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change was ratified by the Senate in 1992. The President can implement it or not implement it. He cannot unilaterally withdraw from obligations that the Senate approved and that bind the United States under international law.</p>\n\n<p>Unless we've decided that doesn't matter anymore. Unless executive authority now extends to rewriting the constitutional requirements for treaty-making. Unless \"America First\" means the President can disregard the separation of powers when international commitments are involved.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that no one is seriously contesting this should alarm us. The fact that it's being normalized as presidential prerogative, that it's being framed as housekeeping rather than constitutional significance, that's how precedent gets set. Not with fanfare, but with acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Costs</p>\n\n<p>The immediate costs are practical. Disease surveillance gets harder when we're not part of the World Health Organization. Maritime safety suffers when we withdraw from the organizations that coordinate it. Climate cooperation collapses when we reject the treaties that enable it.</p>\n\n<p>The long-term costs are strategic. Other nations will conclude that the United States is not a reliable partner. They will build alternative systems. They will make agreements without us. American influence will wane not because we're weak, but because we're erratic.</p>\n\n<p>But the constitutional cost is deeper. We are establishing that international commitments are provisional, that treaty obligations don't bind future administrations, that the President can withdraw from any international body he deems contrary to his agenda.</p>\n\n<p>That's not how republics maintain credibility. That's how they become indistinguishable from autocracies, where policy is whatever the leader says it is today.</p>\n\n<p>## The Line That Matters</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned about the \"accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands.\" He understood that constitutional government requires distributing power so that no single authority can act without constraint.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign policy requires executive flexibility. No one disputes that. But withdrawal from treaty obligations that the Senate approved, defunding of organizations that Congress authorized, categorical rejection of international cooperation without legislative input, that's not flexibility. That's consolidation.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether these organizations are perfect. None of them are. The question is whether the President can unilaterally decide that American participation in the international order is optional, that treaty commitments don't bind him, that cooperation depends on his assessment of whether other nations advance \"woke\" agendas.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, we should say so clearly. We should acknowledge that we've changed the Constitution's allocation of foreign policy authority. We should admit that the Senate's role in treaty-making is now ceremonial, that presidential power extends to repudiating any international commitment he finds inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, someone needs to contest it. Congress needs to assert its authority. Courts need to examine whether these withdrawals exceed presidential power. Citizens need to ask whether this is compatible with constitutional government.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we're doing none of those things. We're accepting it as normal. We're treating it as politics, not principle. We're watching the architecture of international order get dismantled by executive order and calling it efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>That's the line that's moving. Not with violence, not with crisis, but with bureaucratic language and categorical withdrawal. The question is whether anyone will defend it.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength. But only when the Union is bound by more than executive preference. Only when commitments mean something beyond the current occupant's agenda. Only when cooperation is seen as strength, not weakness.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served twenty-two years in government work. I signed treaties. I attended multilateral meetings. I sat in rooms where nations with opposing interests found ways to coordinate on narrow, technical problems: disease surveillance, solar panel standards, counter-terrorism intelligence, climate data.</p>\n\n<p>Some of those meetings were productive. Some were bureaucratic theater. All of them represented something specific: the willingness of sovereign nations to bind themselves, however loosely, to shared rules.</p>\n\n<p>This week, the United States withdrew from sixty-six international organizations by presidential memorandum.</p>\n\n<p>Not through Senate debate. Not through public hearings on what these bodies do or whether American participation serves American interests. By executive pen, in a single afternoon, citing \"globalist agendas\" and \"wasted taxpayer dollars.\"</p>\n\n<p>Included in the list: the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the foundation of all international climate diplomacy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which coordinates the world's leading scientists on temperature data. The International Solar Alliance. The Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.</p>\n\n<p>Sixty-six organizations. One memo.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about climate policy. This is about the architecture of accountability.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution specifies that the president may make treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur.\" It does not specify what happens when a president withdraws from them.</p>\n\n<p>That silence has created a loophole large enough to drive an entire foreign policy through.</p>\n\n<p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and ratified by the Senate with a vote of unanimous consent. It was not a partisan document. It committed the United States to participate in international efforts to monitor and address climate change, a commitment twenty-eight years in the making.</p>\n\n<p>It now ends, for the second time in five years, by memorandum.</p>\n\n<p>No Senate vote. No public process. No debate over whether the benefits of participation outweigh the costs, whether American scientists should be blocked from attending IPCC meetings in China, whether withdrawing from the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum serves national security.</p>\n\n<p>Just the assertion that these bodies no longer serve American interests, as determined by one person.</p>\n\n<p>The precedent is breathtaking.</p>\n\n<p>## What Withdrawal Actually Means</p>\n\n<p>I want to be specific about what some of these organizations do, because \"globalist agenda\" is a phrase designed to stop thought rather than invite it.</p>\n\n<p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change does not impose carbon taxes. It does not regulate American industry. It provides a forum where nations share temperature data, coordinate emissions monitoring, and negotiate voluntary commitments. American withdrawal means American scientists will be excluded from climate research collaborations. It means the next generation of IPCC reports, which guide global understanding of warming trends, may be delayed or published without American input.</p>\n\n<p>The Global Counter-Terrorism Forum coordinates intelligence sharing among forty member nations on terrorist financing, border security, and emerging threats. Withdrawal does not make America safer. It makes American intelligence agencies less informed.</p>\n\n<p>The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance studies election security, voting systems, and democratic governance. It has no enforcement power. It publishes research.</p>\n\n<p>These are not shadowy cabals imposing world government. They are technical bodies doing the unglamorous work of international coordination. The United States participated in them because participation provided information, influence, and early warning of problems that do not stop at borders.</p>\n\n<p>Withdrawal is not a reassertion of sovereignty. It is the voluntary abandonment of influence.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization of Unilateral Power</p>\n\n<p>I have watched this pattern before. In different contexts, under different administrations, with different justifications.</p>\n\n<p>An emergency power is asserted. It is used. It becomes normal. The next use is broader. The emergency becomes the baseline.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is the normalization of unilateral withdrawal from binding commitments made by previous governments and ratified by the Senate. The principle being established is that any president may exit any treaty, at any time, for any reason, without legislative consultation.</p>\n\n<p>That principle does not stop with climate agreements or democracy institutes.</p>\n\n<p>If a president may withdraw from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change without Senate approval, may they withdraw from NATO without Senate approval? From the Geneva Conventions? From mutual defense treaties with Japan or South Korea?</p>\n\n<p>The White House will say those are different. But on what constitutional basis? If the ratification power resides in the Senate but the withdrawal power resides solely in the executive, then treaty commitments are only as durable as the current occupant of the Oval Office.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a treaty. That is a memo.</p>\n\n<p>## What We Are Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>The debate over these withdrawals has focused on climate science, on whether global warming is real, on whether international cooperation is good policy.</p>\n\n<p>Those are important questions. They are not the constitutional question.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is this: Can a president, acting alone, nullify commitments made by the United States government and ratified by the Senate?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then the Senate's treaty power is ornamental. Any international commitment can be undone by the next election. America's word lasts four years.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then these withdrawals should be challenged in court, and Congress should clarify through statute what the withdrawal process requires.</p>\n\n<p>We are not having that debate. We are having a debate about climate models and taxpayer dollars and globalism, as if those are the questions that matter most.</p>\n\n<p>They are not. The question that matters most is whether the constitutional process for making and keeping commitments still binds the executive branch.</p>\n\n<p>No one in power seems interested in asking it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern Across Administrations</p>\n\n<p>I am not blind to history. Presidents of both parties have stretched executive power. President Obama used executive action to enter the Paris Climate Agreement without Senate ratification, precisely because he knew the Senate would not ratify it. President Trump withdrew from it by the same unilateral method.</p>\n\n<p>Both actions were constitutionally questionable. Both normalized the idea that international commitments do not require legislative process.</p>\n\n<p>The difference now is scale. Sixty-six organizations in one day. Not controversial treaties subject to partisan divide, but technical bodies on solar energy and election security and scientific research.</p>\n\n<p>The assertion is not that these specific agreements are flawed. The assertion is that the president has plenary authority to exit any international commitment, for any reason, without constraint.</p>\n\n<p>That assertion is incompatible with the constitutional design.</p>\n\n<p>## What Is Being Lost</p>\n\n<p>When the United States withdraws from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, American scientists lose access to the coordinated global research that shapes understanding of temperature trends, sea level rise, and extreme weather patterns.</p>\n\n<p>When we withdraw from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, we lose the ability to share intelligence on election interference and authoritarian tactics threatening democratic systems worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>When we withdraw from the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, we lose real-time coordination with allies on terrorist financing networks.</p>\n\n<p>These are not symbolic losses. They are operational losses. They make America less informed, less influential, and less secure.</p>\n\n<p>But the greater loss is constitutional. We are normalizing the idea that binding commitments are not binding. That the word of the United States lasts only until the next administration. That treaties ratified by the Senate can be discarded by a president who finds them inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>If that becomes the standard, no nation will negotiate durable agreements with us. Why would they? Our commitments mean nothing.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution created a system of separated powers because the Founders understood that concentrated authority, even in well-meaning hands, tends toward tyranny.</p>\n\n<p>The treaty power was deliberately shared between the executive and legislative branches. The president negotiates. The Senate consents. Both are required.</p>\n\n<p>That design was not an accident. It was meant to ensure that international commitments reflected the deliberate judgment of the American people through their representatives, not the preferences of a single executive.</p>\n\n<p>If withdrawal from treaties requires no Senate involvement, then that design is dead.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a partisan argument. It is a constitutional one. The question is not whether climate agreements are good policy. The question is whether the process by which we make and break international commitments still reflects the constitutional structure.</p>\n\n<p>It does not.</p>\n\n<p>Sixty-six organizations. One memo. No debate.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a republic governs. That is how an executive rules.</p>\n\n<p>The question we should be asking is not whether these organizations served American interests. The question we should be asking is whether a single person, without legislative check, should have the power to exit commitments made by the United States government.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is in the Constitution. We need only look.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

He has offered to do this \"the easy way or the hard way.\" The White House confirms it will not rule out annexing this territory by force.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a negotiating position. This is a declaration that might makes right.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in service to this country's defense. I know the strategic importance of Arctic territory. I know the value of early warning systems and the challenges of monitoring Russian submarine activity. I know that Greenland's location matters to American security.</p>\n\n<p>But I also know this: We already have a base there. We already have defense agreements. We already have the capability to bring as many troops as we need under existing treaties with Denmark. The strategic value is secured.</p>\n\n<p>So what, exactly, requires ownership?</p>\n\n<p>The president says countries need ownership, not leases. That leases are insufficient for defense. That America must possess Greenland because we cannot trust agreements with allies.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what that means.</p>\n\n<p>It means treaties are worthless. It means alliances are temporary. It means that when strategic interest demands it, sovereign borders become suggestions. It means the United States, when it perceives necessity, will take what it wants from those weaker than itself.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Greenland's minerals or its melting ice revealing rare earth deposits. This is about whether law constrains power or merely decorates it.</p>\n\n<p>The Greenlandic people have spoken clearly: \"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\" Their political leaders, across parties, issued a joint statement. This is not a divided population waiting for liberation. This is a people defending their right to self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>Self-determination. The principle America claimed in 1776. The principle we supposedly fought for in two world wars. The principle enshrined in the UN Charter that our NATO allies invoked this week: \"sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders.\"</p>\n\n<p>Unless, apparently, we decide otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>**What Alliances Mean**</p>\n\n<p>Denmark is a NATO member. NATO operates on Article 5: an attack on one is an attack on all. It is the most successful military alliance in history precisely because its members trust that their sovereignty will be respected, that their territorial integrity is guaranteed by collective defense.</p>\n\n<p>Now the United States is threatening to seize territory from a NATO ally. By force if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark's foreign ministry stated that military action against Greenland would spell the end of NATO. That is not hyperbole. That is a simple statement of fact. An alliance whose leading member annexes territory from another member has no meaning. It is not an alliance. It is a protection racket.</p>\n\n<p>Every NATO member now must ask: If America will threaten Denmark, what prevents them from threatening us? If strategic interest outweighs treaty obligations with Copenhagen, why would it not outweigh them with Warsaw, with Tallinn, with Vilnius?</p>\n\n<p>The President says NATO needs to understand this. What NATO understands is that American security guarantees may be worthless if they conflict with American ambitions.</p>\n\n<p>**The Venezuela Precedent**</p>\n\n<p>This isn't happening in isolation. Days before the Greenland statements, the administration used military force to seize Venezuela's president. Whatever one thinks of Nicolás Maduro, whatever crimes he may have committed, the United States deployed military power to extract a head of state from a sovereign nation.</p>\n\n<p>The easy way or the hard way.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is clear. When the President determines that American interests require it, sovereign borders become irrelevant. International law becomes optional. The wishes of the people living in those territories become background noise.</p>\n\n<p>This is how empires think. This is not how republics think.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 41: \"Security against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society. It is an avowed and essential object of the American Union.\" He was right. National security is fundamental. But Madison also knew that republics could become empires, that the pursuit of security could become the pursuit of dominion.</p>\n\n<p>Security justifies defense. It does not justify conquest.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether Greenland is strategically valuable. The question is whether strategic value justifies taking sovereign territory by force.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether Denmark would sell Greenland. Denmark has said clearly it will not, and Greenland's people have said they don't want to be sold. The question is whether that refusal matters.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether America has the military power to take Greenland. We obviously do. The question is whether power alone determines right.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether other nations would do the same. Russia annexed Crimea using precisely this logic: strategic necessity, historical connection, the wishes of great powers overriding the sovereignty of small nations. We condemned it then. The question is whether we will embrace it now.</p>\n\n<p>Every American should ask: If strategic interest justifies seizing friendly territory, what principle limits that power? If treaty obligations can be discarded when inconvenient, what promises can any nation trust? If the rule of law applies only when expedient, why have law at all?</p>\n\n<p>These aren't abstract questions. These are the questions that determine whether we remain a republic or become something else.</p>\n\n<p>**The Architecture of Restraint**</p>\n\n<p>The American system was built on a profound distrust of concentrated power. The Founders understood that good intentions do not make tyranny impossible. They understood that today's emergency becomes tomorrow's precedent. They understood that power, once claimed, is rarely surrendered.</p>\n\n<p>That's why they built restraints. Separation of powers. Federalism. Enumerated authorities. The requirement that treaties be ratified by the Senate. The principle that Congress alone declares war.</p>\n\n<p>These restraints exist because the Founders knew that executives claiming emergency always have reasons. The threat is always real. The necessity is always pressing. The action is always temporary.</p>\n\n<p>And the precedent is always permanent.</p>\n\n<p>When the President says we need to own Greenland \"the easy way or the hard way,\" he is not just threatening Denmark. He is declaring that American power answers to no law but necessity, to no authority but itself.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the statement of a republic. That is the statement of an empire.</p>\n\n<p>**In Union There is Strength**</p>\n\n<p>Our alliances were built on shared principle, not shared profit. We defended Europe not because it enriched us but because we believed in collective security, in the rule of law, in the sovereignty of nations. We built NATO not to extract tribute but to prevent aggression.</p>\n\n<p>Those alliances made us stronger. Not because we dominated them, but because they trusted us. Trust is strategic value. Trust is what allows forward basing. Trust is what enables intelligence sharing. Trust is what makes collective defense possible.</p>\n\n<p>Threatening to seize Greenland destroys that trust. Saying \"the easy way or the hard way\" to an ally destroys that trust. Making NATO members wonder if their sovereignty is contingent on our convenience destroys that trust.</p>\n\n<p>Trust, once lost, cannot be rebuilt by force.</p>\n\n<p>The Greenlandic people have said they want to remain Greenlandic. Denmark has said the territory is not for sale. Our NATO allies have reaffirmed their commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity. The question is whether America will honor those principles or abandon them in pursuit of strategic advantage.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, defines who we are.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have watched governments restrict press access before. I have seen authorities justify closing borders and controlling information in the name of security. I have reviewed intelligence dossiers that justified surveillance in wartime. But I have never seen a democratic state ban humanitarian organizations for the crime of describing what they see.</p>\n\n<p>That is what Israel has done.</p>\n\n<p>On January 1, Israel barred Doctors Without Borders and approximately forty other international aid groups from entering Gaza and the West Bank. The stated reason: failure to meet new \"security and transparency standards.\" The practical effect: silencing independent witnesses to what is happening in a territory under military occupation.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Hamas. This is about accountability.</p>\n\n<p>## The Mechanism of Control</p>\n\n<p>The new Israeli registration requirements are precise. Aid groups must provide complete disclosure of all staff identities and roles. They must not engage in \"delegitimization activities against Israel\" or \"legal persecution of IDF soldiers.\" Their licenses can be revoked for supporting findings that Israel opposes, including international legal determinations.</p>\n\n<p>These are not security measures. These are speech codes.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what Israel demands: aid workers must hand over staff lists to a party to the conflict, knowing that more than 400 aid workers have been killed in Gaza in the past two years. They must refrain from documenting what international law defines as potential war crimes. They must not testify to what they witness if that testimony might be used in international courts.</p>\n\n<p>This is asking humanitarian workers to choose between bearing witness and maintaining access. It is making documentation itself a disqualifying act.</p>\n\n<p>## When Neutrality Requires Silence</p>\n\n<p>Doctors Without Borders has operated in conflict zones for decades. It treated casualties in Chechnya, Syria, Yemen. It maintained presence under Taliban rule, in territories controlled by ISIS, in regions where governments and insurgents both operated. It did so by maintaining strict neutrality: treating all wounded regardless of faction, documenting conditions without political judgment, and speaking truthfully about what its medical teams observe.</p>\n\n<p>Israel now says this constitutes abandonment of neutrality.</p>\n\n<p>The charge is revealing. What Israel calls \"delegitimization\" is what medical organizations call testimony. MSF staff described children with severe burns from Israeli airstrikes. They documented malnutrition consistent with famine conditions. They reported seeing people shot while seeking food at distribution sites Israel established and protected.</p>\n\n<p>These are observations, not accusations. They are recorded in medical files, verified by physical evidence, corroborated across multiple facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Israel's position is that such descriptions are inherently hostile. That bearing witness is itself an act of delegitimization. That neutrality requires not documenting suffering if that documentation might support legal claims Israel disputes.</p>\n\n<p>This is not how free societies treat evidence.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>The United States faces a version of this question constantly: when does national security justify restricting information? When can the government control who may enter zones of conflict? When does operational necessity trump the public's right to independent verification?</p>\n\n<p>The answers are established in law and precedent. The government may restrict access for specific military necessity, but not to prevent documentation of its actions. It may classify information that would compromise operations, but not embarrass officials. It may control borders, but not to ensure only favorable accounts emerge.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in the Virginia Report of 1800 that \"a popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy.\" He was defending the right of citizens to receive information even during the quasi-war with France. The principle was that representative government requires informed judgment, and informed judgment requires independent access to facts.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli ban operates in reverse. It ensures that only official accounts reach the public. It removes independent medical verification. It eliminates the possibility of documentation that might contradict state narratives.</p>\n\n<p>This is not unique to Israel. Governments at war have always sought to control information. What is new is claiming this as a legitimate security measure compatible with democratic governance. What is dangerous is the precedent: that humanitarian access can be conditioned on political silence, that bearing witness can be classified as hostile activity, that medical testimony can be suppressed as delegitimization.</p>\n\n<p>## The American Interest</p>\n\n<p>The United States provides military aid to Israel under laws requiring that recipients not restrict humanitarian assistance. The Foreign Assistance Act conditions aid on compliance with international humanitarian law. The Leahy Law prohibits assistance to units credibly accused of gross human rights violations.</p>\n\n<p>These laws assume verification. They assume independent monitors can document conditions. They assume the United States can base policy on facts rather than assurances.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli ban eliminates that assumption. It removes the independent observers whose reports inform congressional oversight. It ensures that future assessments of humanitarian conditions will rely on Israeli military sources or exhausted local staff working without international expertise, supplies, or protection.</p>\n\n<p>This affects American law. It affects American appropriations. It affects American compliance with statutes governing foreign assistance. And it creates a precedent: that recipients of American military aid may restrict access, control information, and prevent documentation of how that aid is used.</p>\n\n<p>That precedent extends beyond this conflict. If conditioning humanitarian access on political silence is acceptable, then every recipient of American assistance has a model. If removing independent witnesses is justified by security necessity, then oversight becomes optional. If medical testimony can be classified as delegitimization, then evidence becomes whatever the government says it is.</p>\n\n<p>## What History Shows</p>\n\n<p>In 1968, the My Lai massacre remained hidden for over a year because independent journalists had limited access to operational areas in Vietnam. When exposed, the revelations shocked the American public and changed the conduct of the war. The lesson was not that the press should have been excluded further. It was that military operations in a democracy require independent verification precisely because governments cannot be trusted to investigate themselves.</p>\n\n<p>During the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s, humanitarian organizations provided the documentation that later formed the basis for war crimes prosecutions. The Srebrenica massacre, initially denied by Serbian forces and obscured by competing claims, was verified through medical examinations, refugee interviews, and physical evidence collected by aid workers who maintained access through the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is consistent. Independent witnesses serve not the enemy but the historical record. They provide evidence that can support or refute claims by all parties. Their presence constrains atrocities not by preventing them but by ensuring they will be documented, investigated, and judged.</p>\n\n<p>Israel now says such documentation is illegitimate. That the presence of observers who might testify against state actions is itself a security threat. That humanitarian access must be conditioned on silence about what is witnessed.</p>\n\n<p>This is the logic of impunity.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Israel's security concerns are legitimate. The question is whether those concerns justify eliminating independent verification of what occurs in occupied territory.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether aid organizations have political views. The question is whether medical observations constitute delegitimization or evidence.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Israel has the power to impose these restrictions. The question is whether such restrictions are compatible with democratic governance, international humanitarian law, and American legal obligations.</p>\n\n<p>These are not abstract questions. They determine whether independent fact-finding is possible in conflict zones. They determine whether medical testimony is protected or can be classified as hostile activity. They determine whether American military assistance enables actions that cannot withstand documentation.</p>\n\n<p>The answers matter beyond this conflict. They establish whether democracies at war must tolerate independent verification or may remove witnesses. They establish whether conditioning aid on political silence is a legitimate security measure or suppression of evidence. They establish whether international humanitarian law means what it says or can be suspended when documentation becomes inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>## A 14-year-old needs surgery his mother cannot afford. An 8-year-old with severe burns needs specialized care unavailable in Gaza's shattered hospitals. A young man with shrapnel wounds needs physical therapy his body will never fully recover without.</p>\n\n<p>These are not abstractions. These are people named in medical files at MSF clinics that may close because Israel has classified medical testimony as delegitimization.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is whether a society that values liberty can support restrictions on humanitarian access designed to prevent documentation of suffering. The policy question is whether the United States should condition military assistance on allowing independent verification. The moral question is whether we are comfortable with a precedent that treats bearing witness as grounds for exclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Those questions remain open. The closures proceed.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in government. You learn to read the distance between what is said and what can actually be done.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump says Iran wants to negotiate. He says a meeting is being set up. Iran's government has said nothing of the kind.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a diplomatic breakthrough. This is something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern of Claimed Authority</p>\n\n<p>Trump has threatened military strikes against Iran over its crackdown on protesters. Death toll: at least 544. More than 10,600 detained. The internet is shut down. Phone lines are cut. Iran's Revolutionary Guard is sending text messages warning parents to keep their children off the streets or face charges of treason.</p>\n\n<p>The President says he may have to act before any meeting takes place. \"We may have to act because of what's happening before the meeting.\"</p>\n\n<p>Here is the constitutional question: On what authority would the United States strike Iran to protect Iranian protesters from their own government?</p>\n\n<p>Not treaty obligation. Not defense of American forces. Not imminent threat to the homeland.</p>\n\n<p>Humanitarian intervention by unilateral presidential order.</p>\n\n<p>That's not in Article II. It's not anywhere in the Constitution. Congress has the power to declare war. The President is Commander in Chief of forces Congress authorizes. Even the War Powers Resolution, passed over a presidential veto in 1973, requires notification within 48 hours and withdrawal within 60 days absent congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Trump is discussing military action as if it requires only his decision. As if Iran's internal brutality, however horrific, creates presidential war power by executive will alone.</p>\n\n<p>This is how constitutional boundaries disappear, not through dramatic confrontation but through the quiet assertion that what was never authorized has somehow become permissible.</p>\n\n<p>## The Diplomatic Claim That Cannot Be Verified</p>\n\n<p>\"Iran called, they want to negotiate.\"</p>\n\n<p>Iran's Foreign Minister just told foreign diplomats in Tehran that \"the situation has come under total control.\" He blamed the U.S. and Israel for the violence. He called for pro-government rallies. Iranian state television broadcast chants of \"Death to America!\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not the posture of a government seeking talks.</p>\n\n<p>Oman's Foreign Minister did travel to Iran this weekend. Oman has served as an intermediary before, most notably in the negotiations that led to the 2015 nuclear agreement. But intermediation requires two parties willing to talk.</p>\n\n<p>What we have instead is a president claiming negotiations are imminent while threatening strikes, and an Iranian government showing no interest in compromise while conducting a violent crackdown.</p>\n\n<p>This matters because the claim of negotiations justifies delay in congressional consultation. If talks are happening, if a diplomatic solution is within reach, then perhaps Congress need not be involved yet. Perhaps the President needs flexibility.</p>\n\n<p>But if no negotiations are actually happening, then what we have is the executive branch manufacturing a justification for unilateral action while sidelining the legislative branch's constitutional role in decisions about war.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned against this in Federalist 51: \"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\" The separation of powers exists precisely to prevent one branch from claiming authority it does not possess.</p>\n\n<p>## The Crisis That Justifies Anything</p>\n\n<p>The situation in Iran is genuinely terrible. Protesters are being killed. The internet blackout prevents verification of what is happening. The government is warning parents their children will be charged with treason for demonstrating.</p>\n\n<p>This creates real moral pressure to do something.</p>\n\n<p>But \"something must be done\" has justified nearly every expansion of executive power in American history. The Alien and Sedition Acts. Suspension of habeas corpus. Japanese internment. Warrantless surveillance. Indefinite detention. Drone strikes without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, the emergency was real. Each time, the claim was that normal constitutional processes were too slow, too cumbersome, inadequate to the crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, the expansion of executive power persisted long after the emergency ended.</p>\n\n<p>Lincoln suspended habeas corpus to preserve the Union. The government still claims authority to detain American citizens without trial as enemy combatants. That's 160 years of constitutional erosion stemming from a Civil War emergency.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Iran's government is brutal. It is.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether that brutality authorizes the American President to launch military strikes without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>The answer under the Constitution is no.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>Trump's national security team is weighing \"cyberattacks and direct strikes by the U.S. or Israel.\" Anonymous sources. Not authorized to comment publicly.</p>\n\n<p>If the President orders strikes, will he notify Congress within 48 hours as the War Powers Resolution requires?</p>\n\n<p>Will he seek congressional authorization if operations continue beyond 60 days?</p>\n\n<p>Will he claim that protecting protesters from their government constitutes defense of vital national interests?</p>\n\n<p>Will Congress insist on its constitutional role, or will it defer to executive judgment?</p>\n\n<p>These are not hypothetical questions. This is how we find out whether the Constitution still governs decisions about war, or whether it has become merely advisory when the President believes circumstances require action.</p>\n\n<p>Iran's parliament speaker warned that U.S. military forces and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if America uses force. That means American service members' lives would be at risk.</p>\n\n<p>Those service members swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. They are entitled to know that when they are sent into harm's way, it is pursuant to constitutional authority, not presidential assertion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Silence That Matters Most</p>\n\n<p>Congress has said almost nothing.</p>\n\n<p>No demand for briefings. No insistence on consultation before any military action. No assertion of its constitutional role in decisions about war.</p>\n\n<p>Just silence.</p>\n\n<p>That silence is more dangerous than Trump's threats. Presidents will always claim emergency power. What matters is whether Congress defends its constitutional role.</p>\n\n<p>If it does not, if it simply accepts presidential claims to unilateral war-making authority, then the constitutional structure for decisions about war has effectively been amended without going through Article V.</p>\n\n<p>Not by vote. Not by debate. By acquiescence.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Trump or Iran or this particular crisis. It's about whether Congress will defend its constitutional role in decisions that risk American lives, or whether that role has simply been surrendered to the executive branch.</p>\n\n<p>The test of constitutional government is not whether power is used wisely. It is whether power is exercised lawfully.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, a president is threatening military action without clear constitutional authority, claiming negotiations that cannot be verified, and facing no meaningful congressional constraint.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how the Constitution allocates war powers.</p>\n\n<p>The question for Congress is simple: Do you still claim your constitutional role, or have you given it away?</p>\n\n<p>The silence is the answer.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have stood in polling places on three continents. I have watched citizens in new democracies wait hours to cast ballots they believed would matter. I have also stood in places where voting was theater, where the outcome was known, where the process existed not to choose leaders but to ratify power already held.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in Uganda is not an election in the sense we understand it. It is a ritual of legitimation.</p>\n\n<p>President Yoweri Museveni has ruled for forty years. He came to power in 1986 condemning leaders who \"want to overstay in power.\" That was the year I graduated from college. Children born when he took office are now forty years old, have children of their own, and have never known another president. His son commands the military and posts on social media about his inevitable succession.</p>\n\n<p>This is not democracy. This is dynasty with electoral aesthetics.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Inevitability</p>\n\n<p>The internet is shut down. Hundreds of activists are detained. Opposition rallies are dispersed with tear gas. Journalists face restrictions. The challenger campaigns in body armor because he has been shot by police. Voters are barred from observing vote counts.</p>\n\n<p>The government calls these measures \"security.\"</p>\n\n<p>That word does important work. It transforms repression into protection. It makes the abnormal sound responsible. It suggests that shutting down communications, arresting dissidents, and blocking election monitors are not instruments of control but responses to threat.</p>\n\n<p>This is how temporary becomes permanent. This is how exception becomes rule.</p>\n\n<p>The Uganda Communications Commission says the internet blackout is \"a precautionary intervention to ensure peace, protect national stability and prevent the misuse of communication platforms during a sensitive national exercise.\" Note the language: precautionary, ensure, protect, prevent. This is the vocabulary of guardianship, not governance. It assumes that the population cannot be trusted with information during the very moment they are asked to make decisions about their future.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison understood what this reveals: \"A popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps both.\"</p>\n\n<p>## The Performance of Consent</p>\n\n<p>Elections under these conditions serve a purpose, but it is not selection. They demonstrate reach. They map support. They identify opposition. They create the appearance of legitimacy for international consumption. They let the government claim a mandate.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, they normalize the arrangement.</p>\n\n<p>Every time this happens without consequence, the idea that it could be otherwise recedes. The opposition candidate campaigns despite knowing he will not be allowed to win. Voters cast ballots despite knowing the outcome. International observers issue reports. Western governments express concern. And nothing changes.</p>\n\n<p>This is not accident. This is design.</p>\n\n<p>The process teaches learned helplessness. It demonstrates that resistance is performative, that opposition is tolerated only when it is ineffective, that the forms of democracy can persist indefinitely without any of its substance.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen this before. I watched it in places where militaries held elections to demonstrate civilian support. I watched it in places where one-party states held votes to show popular approval. The mechanics differ. The lesson is the same: power concedes nothing without compulsion, and compulsion requires organization that the state will not permit.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>Here is what matters: Museveni is strategically valuable to Western governments. He deploys troops to trouble spots. He accepts deportees. He cooperates on counterterrorism. He is, in the language of realpolitik, \"our son of a bitch.\"</p>\n\n<p>This calculation is not new. It justified support for autocrats throughout the Cold War. It justified relationships with regimes that imprisoned dissidents, banned opposition, controlled media, and called it stability.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether those relationships undermine the very principles they claim to defend.</p>\n\n<p>When we accept that elections can be theater as long as the theater serves our interests, we are not defending democracy. We are defending its opposite. We are saying that legitimacy comes from cooperation with us, not consent of the governed.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham Lincoln said it plainly: \"No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.\"</p>\n\n<p>That principle does not have a geopolitical exception.</p>\n\n<p>## What We Are Watching</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-one million Ugandans are registered to vote. Most are under forty. They have lived their entire lives under one ruler. They are voting in an election where the internet is shut down, activists are jailed, opposition is harassed, and observers are blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Some will vote for Museveni because they support him. Some will vote for him because they fear the alternative. Some will vote for the opposition knowing it will not matter. Some will not vote at all.</p>\n\n<p>But they will all absorb the lesson that power does not change through peaceful means, that law protects authority rather than rights, that elections are not mechanisms of accountability but ceremonies of submission.</p>\n\n<p>That lesson does not stay in Uganda. It travels. It spreads. It becomes precedent.</p>\n\n<p>Every time an election happens under these conditions without consequence, the idea that it must be otherwise weakens. Every time we accept strategic autocracy as lesser evil, we erode the ground on which free societies stand.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>The question is not what will happen in Uganda. We know what will happen. Museveni will be declared the winner. There will be allegations of fraud. There will be international statements. There will be no change.</p>\n\n<p>The question is what that means for the principle that legitimate government derives from the consent of the governed.</p>\n\n<p>If that principle matters, it matters everywhere. If it matters everywhere, it cannot coexist with tactical exceptions. If we defend democracy only where it serves our interests, we do not defend democracy. We defend interests.</p>\n\n<p>I am not suggesting military intervention. I am not proposing sanctions. I am asking whether we have the clarity to call this what it is.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an election. This is a demonstration that elections can exist without democracy, that the forms can persist without the substance, that legitimacy can be claimed without consent.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "headline": "When Federal Force Becomes the First Response",
      "content": "<p>I served under rules of engagement more restrictive than what we're seeing in American cities.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a political statement. It's a fact. In Iraq, in Afghanistan, our authority to use force was bounded by law, by treaty, by chain of command, and by the knowledge that every shot fired would be investigated. We operated in combat zones under stricter accountability than ICE agents are operating in Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p>This matters now because the President has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress protests against federal law enforcement operations. Not to repel an invasion. Not to restore order after state authority has collapsed. To quell opposition to how federal agents are conducting immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>That's a different use of the military than the law contemplates.</p>\n\n<p>The Insurrection Act of 1807 permits the President to deploy active-duty military forces for domestic law enforcement under specific circumstances: when state authorities request help, when rebellion makes it impossible to enforce federal law, or when civil rights are being systematically denied. It has been invoked sparingly, twenty-nine times in 217 years, most recently in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots after California's governor requested assistance.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump has threatened to invoke it not because Minnesota lacks the capacity to maintain order, but because Minnesota officials oppose how federal agents are operating within their jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>That's not the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>## What Happened in Minneapolis</p>\n\n<p>The facts are these: On January 7, 2026, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good during what the administration calls a law enforcement operation and what video footage shows as a woman attempting to drive away while an agent stood in front of her vehicle. Three shots. The FBI is investigating.</p>\n\n<p>One week later, an ICE agent shot another man in the leg after what DHS characterizes as an ambush with a snow shovel and broom handle. Protests followed. Property was damaged. Federal vehicles were vandalized.</p>\n\n<p>The President then threatened to send in the military if state and local officials did not \"stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists.\"</p>\n\n<p>The predicate for military deployment is not that protests became disorderly. It is that civil authority has failed to function. There is no evidence that Minnesota lacks the capability to maintain order. The state has not requested assistance. The governor has asked to \"turn the temperature down,\" not for troops.</p>\n\n<p>What we're seeing instead is a federal operation generating local resistance, that resistance being labeled insurrection, and military force being threatened to suppress it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Accountability</p>\n\n<p>Three thousand federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota. That is more federal law enforcement personnel than are permanently stationed in most states. They are conducting what ICE calls Operation Metro Surge, making arrests, conducting raids, and using force under circumstances that remain unclear because the operations are not subject to the transparency requirements that govern local police.</p>\n\n<p>When a city police officer shoots someone, there are procedures. Body cameras. Use-of-force reviews. Public accountability through local government. When an ICE agent shoots someone, the investigation happens within DHS, the footage may or may not be released, and local officials have no authority to compel answers.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine 3,000 such officers operating in a city whose mayor has demanded they leave, whose governor has compared them to the Gestapo, and whose residents are watching videos of federal agents shooting people and wondering whether the law applies.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a stable equilibrium.</p>\n\n<p>The administration's response is to threaten military deployment against citizens protesting federal actions. Not deployment to assist local authorities in maintaining order. Deployment to override local opposition to federal operations.</p>\n\n<p>That changes what the Insurrection Act means.</p>\n\n<p>## The History That Matters</p>\n\n<p>The Act was written in 1807, expanded during Reconstruction, and refined after the civil rights era. It has been used to integrate schools, to suppress the Ku Klux Klan, to restore order after riots, and to enforce federal law when states attempted to nullify it.</p>\n\n<p>It has never been used, as far as I can determine, to suppress protests against how federal agents are conducting law enforcement operations within a jurisdiction where civil authority continues to function.</p>\n\n<p>This matters because the Act was designed as a last resort when the constitutional order breaks down. What we're seeing instead is its use being threatened as a first resort when local officials object to federal tactics.</p>\n\n<p>That is a different kind of power.</p>\n\n<p>When federal force becomes the answer to political opposition, when dissent is labeled insurrection, when local accountability is replaced by federal immunity, you have moved from law enforcement to something else.</p>\n\n<p>You have moved toward the kind of federal supremacy the Founders feared.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether immigration laws should be enforced. The question is under what constraints, with what accountability, and subject to whose authority.</p>\n\n<p>When federal agents operate in American cities under rules less restrictive than soldiers operate under in combat zones, something has gone wrong.</p>\n\n<p>When 3,000 federal officers deploy without local consent or meaningful local oversight, something has changed.</p>\n\n<p>When the military is threatened against citizens protesting federal operations, not because civil authority has failed but because it disagrees, something fundamental has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 51 that \"ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\" The system works when power checks power, when federal authority is balanced by state authority, when accountability runs through multiple channels.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when federal force operates beyond state oversight, when protests against it are labeled insurrection, when the remedy for local opposition is military deployment?</p>\n\n<p>You get power without accountability.</p>\n\n<p>You get force without constraint.</p>\n\n<p>You get exactly what the Constitution was designed to prevent.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath didn't include partisan caveats. It didn't say \"support this administration's policies\" or \"defend these particular outcomes.\" It said defend the constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>That order includes the principle that federal power is limited, that states retain authority, that accountability matters, and that force is employed under law, not instead of it.</p>\n\n<p>When an ICE agent shoots someone, there should be a transparent investigation. When 3,000 federal officers deploy to a city, there should be clarity about their authority and constraints. When the President threatens to send in the military, there should be a clear predicate that goes beyond \"local officials object to our operations.\"</p>\n\n<p>These are not partisan questions. They are constitutional questions about how power works in a republic.</p>\n\n<p>Right now in Minneapolis, federal agents are operating under unclear authority, with limited accountability, generating local opposition that is being labeled insurrection, with military force threatened as the remedy.</p>\n\n<p>If that becomes normal, something essential has been lost.</p>\n\n<p>The Insurrection Act was meant to preserve constitutional government, not to override it when local officials resist federal operations.

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to know how power moves, how it tests boundaries, how it transforms means into ends. What we're witnessing in Minneapolis isn't merely federal immigration enforcement. It's a stress test of constitutional architecture, conducted with tear gas and funding threats.</p>\n\n<p>The facts are straightforward. Federal agents surge into cities. A civilian is killed. Protests erupt. The administration threatens to invoke the Insurrection Act and simultaneously announces it will cut funding to cities that don't cooperate with its enforcement agenda. The method is familiar: create crisis, demand submission, punish resistance.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about immigration policy. This is about whether the federal government can commandeer state and local governments through financial coercion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Architecture</p>\n\n<p>The Founders designed a system of dual sovereignty. James Madison explained it clearly in Federalist 45: \"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\"</p>\n\n<p>That division wasn't accidental. It was structural, deliberate, essential. The federal government enforces immigration law. States and cities run their own police departments, make their own public safety decisions, answer to their own voters. The Constitution does not permit Washington to conscript local law enforcement into federal service, nor to punish states financially for declining to assist.</p>\n\n<p>Courts have repeatedly affirmed this principle. In Printz v. United States (1997), the Supreme Court struck down federal attempts to commandeer state officers. The anti-commandeering doctrine holds that Congress cannot compel states to enforce federal law. The logic is simple: if Washington could force states to implement federal policy, the division of sovereignty would collapse. States would become administrative units, not sovereign governments.</p>\n\n<p>The spending power cases are equally clear. South Dakota v. Dole (1987) established that Congress can attach conditions to federal funding, but those conditions must relate to the purpose of the funds and cannot be so coercive that they amount to compulsion. In NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), the Court found that threatening to withhold all Medicaid funding unless states expanded the program crossed the line into unconstitutional coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Judge William Orrick's ruling blocking the Trump administration's sanctuary city funding threats follows directly from this precedent. The federal government cannot use money as a cudgel to force states to abandon their own policies. That's not federalism. That's subjugation.</p>\n\n<p>## Why Local Cooperation Matters</p>\n\n<p>The administration's frustration is understandable on operational grounds. ICE operated more efficiently when it could pick up individuals already in custody at local jails. Detainer requests—federal holds on individuals about to be released from local custody—streamlined the process.</p>\n\n<p>But efficiency isn't a constitutional argument.</p>\n\n<p>Local jurisdictions adopted sanctuary policies for reasons rooted in their own governance responsibilities. Police chiefs and mayors argued that cooperation with federal immigration enforcement undermined community trust, making immigrant communities reluctant to report crimes or cooperate with investigations. They concluded that their public safety mission required them to separate local policing from federal immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>Those are legitimate policy judgments. Citizens can disagree with them, can vote officials out who make them, can change state law to require cooperation. What citizens cannot do—what the federal government cannot do—is override state sovereignty through financial threats.</p>\n\n<p>The administration's response reveals the deeper problem. When state and local governments make decisions Washington dislikes, the federal playbook increasingly involves federal occupation (surge operations), federal prosecution (investigations of governors and mayors), and federal coercion (funding threats). Each step moves power from diffused to centralized, from accountable to distant, from constitutional order to executive will.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern That Should Concern Us</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this pattern before. An administration identifies a problem. Congress won't or can't act. The executive branch finds authorities—some legitimate, some stretched, some simply asserted—to act unilaterally. Opposition is framed as obstruction. Cooperation is demanded. Resistance is punished.</p>\n\n<p>The mechanisms vary but the trajectory is consistent: concentration of power, erosion of limitations, normalization of the extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what's happening simultaneously in Minnesota:</p>\n\n<p>- Federal agents deploying tear gas against protesters\n- A Justice Department investigation of state and local officials\n- Threats to invoke the Insurrection Act\n- Promises to cut federal funding\n- Military personnel operating alongside civilian law enforcement</p>\n\n<p>Each element, taken alone, might have a technical legal justification. Collectively, they represent something else: a demonstration of federal dominance, a warning to other jurisdictions, a redefinition of the relationship between Washington and everywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>This is how federalism dies—not in a single dramatic breach, but through accumulated pressure, through crises real and manufactured, through the transformation of cooperation into compulsion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>The debate has focused on immigration enforcement and sanctuary policies. Those are important questions. But they're not the fundamental question.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental question is this: Can the federal government force state and local governments to implement federal policy by threatening their financial survival?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then federalism is dead. State sovereignty becomes administrative convenience. Local control becomes federal permission. The constitutional architecture collapses into a unitary system with power flowing in one direction—downward from Washington.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood this danger. Hamilton warned in Federalist 17 that the states would be \"constituent and essential parts of the federal government\" whose independence must be preserved. Madison argued in Federalist 46 that state governments could \"effectually oppose\" federal overreach through \"a refusal to cooperate with officers of the Union.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not obstruction. That's constitutional design working as intended.</p>\n\n<p>When Washington attempts to override state resistance through funding coercion, it's not enforcing the law. It's rewriting the constitutional settlement, replacing dual sovereignty with federal supremacy, replacing political accountability with administrative compliance.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Means</p>\n\n<p>Courts will sort out the immediate legal questions. Judges have already blocked similar funding threats. They likely will again. The anti-commandeering doctrine and the spending power limitations are well-established. The administration will lose these cases, just as it did in the first term.</p>\n\n<p>But that misses the point.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that we're normalizing these confrontations, accepting as routine the deployment of federal force into cities over policy disputes, treating as ordinary the threat to cut funding whenever states decline to cooperate. We're moving from federalism as structure to federalism as discretion, from constitutional limits as binding to constitutional limits as negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>I've sworn an oath to the Constitution enough times to know what it means. It means that powers not granted to the federal government remain with the states. It means that the federal government cannot compel state officers to enforce federal law. It means that spending power has limits. It means that federalism isn't just a theory—it's the architecture that makes self-government possible across a diverse republic.</p>\n\n<p>When that architecture erodes, we don't just lose efficiency or clarity. We lose the structural protection that keeps power from accumulating in a single place, that maintains multiple centers of authority, that preserves space for local democracy and political difference.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether you support sanctuary policies or immigration enforcement. The question is whether you believe the Constitution means what it says about the limits of federal power. The question is whether dual sovereignty still matters, or whether we're willing to trade it for the efficiency of centralized control.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in uniform. I served in government. I have sat in rooms where policy becomes action, where words on paper become orders that people follow. So I know what it looks like when power stops being bounded by law and starts being bounded only by will.</p>\n\n<p>What happened Saturday is not a trade policy dispute.</p>\n\n<p>It is the use of economic coercion against treaty allies to compel the transfer of sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump announced a 10% tariff on eight NATO members, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, effective February 1, escalating to 25% by June 1 if they do not facilitate \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States. Not negotiate. Not discuss. Purchase. As if an autonomous territory of 56,000 people, part of a democratic ally since the founding of NATO, were a warehouse property available for hostile takeover.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Greenland's strategic value. It is about whether an American president can weaponize the U.S. economy to dissolve the territorial integrity of allied democracies.</p>\n\n<p>**What Changed Without Announcement**</p>\n\n<p>Tariffs are a tool of trade policy. They address unfair practices, protect domestic industries, respond to economic injury. They operate within a framework of law: statutes, treaties, administrative procedures, judicial review.</p>\n\n<p>This is something else.</p>\n\n<p>These are not tariffs to address dumping or subsidies or market access. They are penalties imposed on allies for the offense of refusing to sell their land. The legal mechanism Trump would likely invoke, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, requires an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security. The threat here is that European nations will not surrender Greenland.</p>\n\n<p>If that becomes the standard for economic emergency powers, then emergency powers have no limiting principle.</p>\n\n<p>If a president can declare any diplomatic impasse a national emergency and unilaterally impose escalating penalties until compliance, then the entire architecture of alliance diplomacy collapses into unilateral will. The question is not whether Trump has the statutory language to attempt this. The question is whether that language was ever meant to authorize what he is attempting.</p>\n\n<p>Congress wrote emergency powers laws after Watergate specifically to constrain unilateral executive action. Section 1701 of IEEPA permits economic measures during a declared national emergency, but the declaration must identify an actual threat, not merely an unmet demand. Tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act require a finding that imports threaten national security, not that allies insufficiently defer.</p>\n\n<p>The law exists. But the law's meaning shifts when its invocation becomes routine, when every refusal becomes a threat, when \"emergency\" describes any inconvenient constraint on executive preference.</p>\n\n<p>**The Alliance Question**</p>\n\n<p>NATO is not a treaty of convenience. It is a mutual defense pact rooted in Article 5: an attack on one is an attack on all. It has held through the Berlin Airlift, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Balkan wars, September 11. Denmark, Norway, the UK, France, Germany, all of them, have sent their people to fight alongside ours under that covenant.</p>\n\n<p>Now the United States is threatening them with economic punishment for declining to cede sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>Senator Chris Coons stood in Copenhagen and said, \"If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?\"</p>\n\n<p>That is the question.</p>\n\n<p>Alliances are built on reliability. When reliability is replaced by ultimatum, when partnership becomes subordination, when \"ally\" means \"complies,\" then alliance becomes something else. It becomes hierarchy enforced by coercion. And hierarchies built on coercion do not endure.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark has been our ally for 77 years. It hosts U.S. forces at Thule Air Base in Greenland. It has committed troops to every major NATO operation. It has stood with us when standing cost blood. And now we are imposing trade penalties because it will not sell us Greenland.</p>\n\n<p>If that is how we treat Denmark, what does Poland believe? What does Estonia believe? What does any smaller ally believe about what America's word is worth?</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Law**</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear, legally, how Trump intends to do this. Tariffs under existing statutory authority require specific findings, agency process, often congressional notification. The president cannot simply tweet a 10% penalty into existence. But the larger question is whether the legal framework itself still operates as a constraint or merely as a formality to be cited post hoc.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 47, \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands... may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" The separation of powers exists not to slow government but to prevent exactly this: the conversion of law into the instrument of unilateral will.</p>\n\n<p>Emergency powers laws were designed to permit swift action in genuine crises, not to bypass Congress whenever diplomacy requires patience. The question is not whether a president has emergency authority. The question is whether that authority extends to creating the emergency it purports to address, to declaring any frustration a crisis, any refusal a threat.</p>\n\n<p>If it does, then Congress no longer legislates trade policy. It merely observes while the executive does.</p>\n\n<p>**What This Normalizes**</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, citing national security under Section 232. Allies objected. Courts mostly deferred. The precedent held: national security is whatever the president says it is, reviewable only at the margins.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, he threatened tariffs on Mexico to force immigration enforcement changes. Mexico complied. The lesson: economic coercion works when the target is weaker.</p>\n\n<p>Now he is applying that lesson to NATO allies, demanding not policy changes but territorial concessions, using trade as the lever. Each escalation builds on the last. Each instance that goes unchallenged becomes the baseline for the next.</p>\n\n<p>This is how norms erode. Not through dramatic constitutional collapse, but through incremental expansion, each step slightly beyond the last, each justified by precedent that itself was justified by convenience. The trade war becomes the diplomatic ultimatum becomes the demand for sovereign territory enforced by escalating economic penalties.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether this violates a specific statute. The question is whether this is compatible with a government of laws.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>Not: Do we want Greenland for strategic reasons?</p>\n\n<p>But: Do we want a presidency that can unilaterally coerce territorial concessions from allied democracies using emergency economic powers?</p>\n\n<p>Not: Are tariffs an effective tool?</p>\n\n<p>But: Are tariffs meant to enforce diplomatic demands that have nothing to do with trade?</p>\n\n<p>Not: Is this technically legal?</p>\n\n<p>But: Does law still constrain executive action, or does it merely describe what the president chooses to do?</p>\n\n<p>These are different questions. They go to structure, not policy. They ask whether power is still accountable to something beyond itself.</p>\n\n<p>**The Precedent**</p>\n\n<p>In 1803, Thomas Jefferson bought Louisiana from France. It was a negotiated purchase between willing parties, ratified by treaty, approved by the Senate. The Constitution did not explicitly authorize it, and Jefferson himself had doubts, but it proceeded through legal process.</p>\n\n<p>In 1867, William Seward bought Alaska from Russia. Again, a negotiated treaty, Senate ratification, legal appropriation.</p>\n\n<p>In 1917, the U.S. purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark. Treaty. Senate consent. Process.</p>\n\n<p>Territorial acquisition has always been exceptional, conducted through law, requiring consent at every level: the selling nation, the Senate, the appropriating Congress. It has never been imposed by presidential ultimatum enforced through unilateral economic penalties.</p>\n\n<p>Until now. If this proceeds.</p>\n\n<p>**The Test**</p>\n\n<p>Thousands marched in Copenhagen and Nuuk on Saturday, holding signs that read \"Greenland is not for sale\" and \"Hands off.\" They were not protesting American strategic interests. They were asserting self-governance. They were reminding the world that people are not property, that sovereignty is not a transaction.</p>\n\n<p>A Danish major general confirmed that Danish soldiers, if attacked on Danish soil, have the legal obligation to fight back. Even, presumably, if the attack comes from an ally.</p>\n\n<p>That is where this leads. Not to war, probably, but to the question of whether war is even conceivable, whether the bonds that held for 77 years still mean what they once did.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether Trump can find statutory language to justify tariffs. The test is whether the American constitutional system permits a president to use economic warfare to coerce territorial concessions from treaty allies, and whether Congress and the courts will allow it.</p>\n\n<p>The test is whether law still limits power, or whether power now defines law.</p>\n\n<p>That is the question this moment asks. And the answer will tell us what we still are.</p>",

Remarkable because it was said aloud.</p>\n\n<p>\"There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power.\"</p>\n\n<p>António Guterres was describing American foreign policy. He could have been describing a principle older than the Republic.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in uniform defending what we called the rules-based international order. That phrase carried weight in briefing rooms and treaty negotiations. It meant something specific: that nations, including powerful ones, would bind themselves to shared rules rather than act solely on interest and capability.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether that binding was ever real, or whether it was a temporary arrangement of convenience that lasted only as long as American power was uncontested and American interests aligned with the appearance of law.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether the UN is effective. It isn't about whether international institutions need reform. It's about whether the United States remains a nation that believes law constrains power, or whether we have decided that our power defines what law means.</p>\n\n<p>**What We Agreed To**</p>\n\n<p>The United States drafted much of the UN Charter. American diplomats, shaped by two world wars, built the architecture of international law precisely to prevent powerful nations from acting with impunity.</p>\n\n<p>Article 2(4) of the Charter prohibits \"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\" The United States signed that treaty. The Senate ratified it. Under Article VI of the Constitution, it became \"the supreme Law of the Land.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not a suggestion. Not an aspiration. Law.</p>\n\n<p>When we helped write those rules in 1945, we understood something essential: that unchecked power, even our own, would eventually become a threat to liberty everywhere. That binding ourselves to law, even when inconvenient, was the price of maintaining a world where smaller nations had any protection at all.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative was the world we had just fought to end. The world where might made right and treaties were worth less than the paper they were printed on.</p>\n\n<p>We chose differently then.</p>\n\n<p>**The Drift**</p>\n\n<p>I served in government when phrases like \"kinetic military action\" replaced \"war\" in official documents. When \"enhanced interrogation\" replaced \"torture.\" When legal memos stretched definitions until they meant their opposite.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern was always the same: Find a way to do what power wanted, then construct a legal justification afterward. Not \"Is this lawful?\" but \"How can we make this appear lawful?\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not law. That's power wearing law's uniform.</p>\n\n<p>Guterres described what anyone watching American foreign policy can see: a nation that considers multilateral solutions irrelevant, that acts first and consults allies later, if at all. A nation that speaks of sovereignty and international law when they serve our interests, and dismisses them when they don't.</p>\n\n<p>The recent strike in Venezuela. The seizure of its president. The threats to annex Greenland, a territory of a NATO ally.</p>\n\n<p>These aren't legal arguments. They're demonstrations of capability.</p>\n\n<p>**The Constitutional Question**</p>\n\n<p>The Founders designed a government that could not easily make war. They split the war power deliberately, giving Congress the authority to declare war and the President the authority to command forces once war was declared.</p>\n\n<p>They did this because they had lived under unchecked executive power. They knew what it became.</p>\n\n<p>\"The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it,\" James Madison wrote. \"It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to the Legislature.\"</p>\n\n<p>Yet we have not formally declared war since 1942. We have fought wars in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, and elsewhere under various authorizations, resolutions, and executive determinations that bear little resemblance to the constitutional process the Founders mandated.</p>\n\n<p>This didn't happen overnight. It happened through accumulation. Through precedent built on precedent, each one citing the last. Through emergency powers that never expired and legal interpretations that never faced serious challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The line didn't move all at once. It drifted.</p>\n\n<p>**What Allies See**</p>\n\n<p>I remember what it meant to represent the United States overseas. To speak about human rights and rule of law with the authority of a nation that, however imperfectly, tried to live by those principles.</p>\n\n<p>That authority came from restraint as much as strength. From the times we could have acted on power alone but chose to work through law instead. From the credibility of being bound by the same rules we asked others to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Allies trusted us not because we were powerful, but because our power was, most of the time, predictable and constrained by institutions they could understand.</p>\n\n<p>When the Secretary-General of the UN describes American policy as a rejection of multilateralism and international law, he is telling us what our allies already know and what our adversaries have long claimed: that we consider ourselves exempt from the constraints we demand others accept.</p>\n\n<p>That is a different kind of power. It is also a different kind of isolation.</p>\n\n<p>**The Normalization**</p>\n\n<p>What concerns me most is not any single action. It's the quiet acceptance of a principle that would have alarmed the Founders: that American power, because it is power, operates in a different category than law.</p>\n\n<p>This principle doesn't announce itself. It accretes through practice. Through the assumption that what we can do, we may do. Through the absence of accountability when power is misused. Through the bipartisan consensus that executive authority in foreign affairs is essentially unchecked.</p>\n\n<p>It becomes normal to strike other nations without congressional authorization. Normal to detain people indefinitely without trial. Normal to invoke national security to avoid judicial review. Normal to treat international law as advisory.</p>\n\n<p>The extraordinary becomes ordinary. The emergency becomes permanent. The exception becomes the rule.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics change. Not through dramatic breaks, but through the steady erosion of constraints that once seemed essential.</p>\n\n<p>**The Test**</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if the rules-based international order can be salvaged. I don't know if institutions designed for 1945 can address 2025's challenges. I don't know if multilateral solutions can solve problems that unilateral power cannot.</p>\n\n<p>But I know this: A nation that believes its power places it above law is no longer constrained by law.</p>\n\n<p>That includes the law that constrains its power at home.</p>\n\n<p>The principle that power defines law doesn't stop at the border. If we are exempt from international law because we are powerful, why should the powerful within our own system be constrained by domestic law?</p>\n\n<p>The logic is the same. The justification is the same. Only the scale differs.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood something we risk forgetting: that unchecked power, even when wielded with good intentions, even when exercised by people we trust, eventually becomes a threat to liberty itself.</p>\n\n<p>They built a system designed to prevent that. A system where law constrained power, where institutions checked ambition, where no person or branch could act without accountability.</p>\n\n<p>That system didn't fail. We stopped maintaining it.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether the UN can reform itself. The question is whether the American people still believe that law should constrain power, or whether we have decided that our power is its own justification.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "headline": "When Sovereignty Becomes Negotiable",
      "content": "<p>The President of the United States has announced that he will impose tariffs on eight NATO allies, including the United Kingdom, unless Denmark agrees to sell Greenland to Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Read that again.</p>\n\n<p>Not tariffs based on trade imbalances. Not tariffs as leverage in a security negotiation. Tariffs as the price for refusing to surrender sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>When asked if he would rule out using military force to take Greenland, the President replied: \"No comment.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Greenland's strategic value. This is about whether territorial integrity is still a principle that governs relations between free nations, or merely a preference that can be coerced away through economic threats.</p>\n\n<p>**The Mechanism Matters**</p>\n\n<p>I have served in government. I understand that nations pursue strategic interests. The United States has legitimate security concerns in the Arctic. Greenland's location matters to continental defense.</p>\n\n<p>But how a nation pursues those interests reveals what kind of nation it is.</p>\n\n<p>The President frames this as about \"National and World Security.\" That framing does important work. It suggests that opposition to the demand is not merely unwise but dangerous, not merely disagreement but dereliction.</p>\n\n<p>Notice what has disappeared from the conversation: any reference to the consent of the governed.</p>\n\n<p>Greenland is home to 56,000 people. They are not a commodity to be purchased. They possess the right to self-determination under international law, recognized in the UN Charter, Article 1. Their premier has stated clearly: \"We are not for sale.\"</p>\n\n<p>That should end the discussion in any framework where popular sovereignty matters.</p>\n\n<p>It has not ended the discussion.</p>\n\n<p>**When Alliances Become Conditional**</p>\n\n<p>The tariff threat targets eight nations. All are NATO members. All are democracies. All stood with the United States after September 11th under Article 5, the mutual defense clause that declares an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark lost 43 soldiers in Afghanistan fighting alongside American forces. Norway lost 10. The United Kingdom lost 457.</p>\n\n<p>They did not die protecting trade advantages. They died because we invoked a treaty that says democracies defend each other.</p>\n\n<p>Now that treaty obligation is being made conditional on compliance with a territorial demand.</p>\n\n<p>The Danish foreign minister stated it plainly: \"You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not rhetoric. That is a statement about what separates law-governed nations from those where power is the only currency that matters.</p>\n\n<p>If sovereignty is negotiable when a stronger power demands it, then every treaty is merely a pause between coercions. Every border is temporary. Every alliance lasts only as long as the stronger party finds it convenient.</p>\n\n<p>**The Normalization**</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time extraordinary measures have been proposed in the name of security. The question is whether they become ordinary.</p>\n\n<p>In 2002, the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed Congress to target those responsible for 9/11. It has since been invoked to justify military action in 18 countries, against groups that did not exist in 2001, without further congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, the Treasury Department received emergency authority to stabilize the financial system. The Troubled Asset Relief Program was sold as temporary and extraordinary. Elements of that emergency authority have been extended and renewed for 15 years.</p>\n\n<p>Extraordinary becomes normal when we stop asking whether the initial justification still applies.</p>\n\n<p>The President's demand is framed as imperative security policy. But security for whom? Greenland already hosts Pituffik Space Base, operated jointly by the United States and Denmark under treaty. NORAD conducts routine operations there with Danish cooperation.</p>\n\n<p>The strategic access already exists. What is being demanded is not access but ownership.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Greenland has strategic value.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the United States can use economic coercion to force a democratic ally to surrender sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then what principle constrains that power? If tariffs can be imposed until Denmark yields Greenland, can they be imposed until Norway yields Svalbard? Until Canada yields the Northwest Passage?</p>\n\n<p>Once sovereignty becomes negotiable through economic threat, what border is secure?</p>\n\n<p>The President has also stated he will not rule out military force. When pressed, he said \"no comment.\" That is not the same as saying no.</p>\n\n<p>In 1939, Germany demanded that Poland cede the Free City of Danzig and grant extraterritorial access through the Polish Corridor. The demand was framed as addressing legitimate security concerns and correcting historical injustices. Poland refused. War followed.</p>\n\n<p>I am not predicting war. I am noting that territorial demands backed by threats have a history. That history does not end well.</p>\n\n<p>**The Test of Principle**</p>\n\n<p>The United States was founded on the proposition that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. That principle is not merely domestic. It is the basis of the international order we built after 1945.</p>\n\n<p>That order has flaws. It has failed often. But it rests on the idea that nations do not simply take what they can, that borders are not merely facts of power, that sovereignty matters.</p>\n\n<p>If we abandon that principle when it becomes inconvenient, we abandon the only framework that prevents international relations from becoming purely a question of force.</p>\n\n<p>The European Union's foreign policy chief said it clearly: \"Sovereignty is not for trade.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not defiance. That is a statement of the principle that makes peaceful coexistence possible.</p>\n\n<p>When the President imposes these tariffs on February 1st, as he has promised \"100%\" he will do, the question will not be whether European economies suffer. The question will be whether economic coercion in pursuit of territorial demands has become an acceptable tool of American statecraft.</p>\n\n<p>If it has, then we are no longer the nation that wrote the Atlantic Charter or designed the United Nations. We are something else.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether we can take Greenland. The test is whether we believe that power alone decides what is ours.</p>\n\n<p>That question, still unanswered, is why this moment matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in government service. I learned early that certain institutions exist not to make governing easier, but to make it harder in specific, necessary ways.</p>\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve is one of those institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Congress created it in 1913 after watching how politics and money interact when no barrier stands between them. The pattern was consistent: financial panics in the 1890s, political pressure for easy credit, economic collapse, repeat. The lesson was not complicated. When presidents can manipulate monetary policy for short-term political gain, the economy destabilizes in predictable ways.</p>\n\n<p>So Congress built a wall. Not an absolute wall, but a procedural one. Federal Reserve governors serve fixed terms. They can be removed for malfeasance, but not for disagreement. Not for setting interest rates the president dislikes. Not for pursuing policies that serve long-term stability over short-term popularity.</p>\n\n<p>That wall has held for 112 years.</p>\n\n<p>This week, the Supreme Court considers whether to demolish it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Argument Being Made</p>\n\n<p>The legal question appears narrow. President Trump seeks to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor appointed by President Biden. The stated cause: irregularities in mortgage applications for two properties. Cook denies wrongdoing. Her lawyers note that four Cabinet members and the deputy attorney general have made similar applications without prosecution. The official who raised the allegations, Bill Pulte, has relatives who did the same.</p>\n\n<p>But the narrow question hides a structural claim.</p>\n\n<p>The administration argues that once the president determines cause exists, that determination is unreviewable by courts. The president's judgment is final. No independent tribunal examines the evidence. No standard of proof applies. If the president says cause exists, cause exists.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Lisa Cook's mortgages.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether \"for cause\" means anything at all.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen this move before, in different contexts. A legal protection remains on paper while its meaning gets hollowed out. The words stay the same. The substance vanishes. You still need \"cause\" to fire a Fed governor, technically. But cause becomes whatever the president says it is, whenever he says it, without review.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a protection. That is permission.</p>\n\n<p>## What Powell Said</p>\n\n<p>Jerome Powell, the Fed chair Trump himself appointed in 2018, is known for careful language and institutional deference. He avoided confrontation even as Trump publicly called him incompetent or crooked. He stayed quiet when the administration opened a criminal investigation into his Senate testimony about building renovations.</p>\n\n<p>Then Powell spoke clearly.</p>\n\n<p>\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of federal reserve buildings. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president.\"</p>\n\n<p>Powell used the word \"pretexts.\" That is the language of someone who has watched procedure become theater, who has seen legal mechanisms deployed not for their stated purpose but to achieve a different end.</p>\n\n<p>He is describing what happens when the question is not whether cause exists, but whether claiming cause is sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>## Why Congress Built the Wall</p>\n\n<p>The argument for presidential control has constitutional weight. Article II vests executive power in the president. Proponents argue he cannot execute that power if he cannot remove officials who resist his direction.</p>\n\n<p>But Congress has constitutional power too. Article I grants it authority to structure how government operates, including creating institutions that check executive discretion. The first Congress, which included many Founders, created the First Bank of the United States in 1791 with term-limited leadership precisely to insulate financial policy from direct presidential control.</p>\n\n<p>They had watched how monarchs manipulate currency. They understood that elected executives face the same temptations.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether the president has executive power. The question is whether that power extends to controlling monetary policy through personnel removal, when Congress specifically designed an institution to prevent that control.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Tarullo, a former Fed governor and Harvard law professor, explains the economic reality: \"Presidents of both parties always want interest rates to go down, particularly in election years, but that inevitably destabilizes the economy.\"</p>\n\n<p>When long-term rates rise because markets fear inflation, mortgages and business investment suffer. The political incentive is always for short-term stimulus. The economic necessity is often for long-term restraint. Congress created the Fed to resolve that tension by removing the decision from political calculation.</p>\n\n<p>If the president can fire Fed governors who resist his preferences, that resolution fails. The Fed becomes what it was designed not to be: an instrument of presidential economic policy.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization Pattern</p>\n\n<p>I am watching a familiar pattern unfold.</p>\n\n<p>First, you claim emergency authority for extraordinary circumstances. Then you find ordinary circumstances that arguably fit the emergency framework. Then the framework becomes routine. Then the exception becomes the rule.</p>\n\n<p>The administration is not arguing it can fire Fed governors at will. It is arguing it can fire them for cause, and that presidential determination of cause is unreviewable.</p>\n\n<p>But unreviewable determination is functionally equivalent to at-will removal. If I can fire you whenever I decide sufficient cause exists, and no one can challenge that decision, then I can fire you whenever I want. The \"for cause\" requirement becomes a formality, a box to check, not a constraint on power.</p>\n\n<p>Every living Fed chair except Powell has signed briefs opposing this change. Treasury secretaries from both parties have too. So have prominent economists across the political spectrum. Jamie Dimon, not known for alarmism, warns of \"reverse consequences\" including higher inflation and increased borrowing costs.</p>\n\n<p>These are not partisans defending bureaucratic turf. These are people who understand what happens when short-term political pressure drives monetary policy.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Court Said Before</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court, in recent emergency docket rulings, allowed Trump to remove other agency heads with term protections. But in one opinion, the conservative majority noted the Fed is different: \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"</p>\n\n<p>That distinction recognizes something important. Some institutions exist not to implement presidential policy but to constrain it. They are countermajoritarian by design, built to resist immediate political pressure in service of longer-term stability.</p>\n\n<p>The question before the Court is whether that distinction still holds. Whether the constitutional structure allows Congress to create institutions genuinely independent of direct presidential control, or whether Article II executive power ultimately subsumes everything.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>This is not about whether Lisa Cook should be a Fed governor. This is not about whether Trump's economic policy preferences are sound. This is not even about whether the Federal Reserve as currently structured is the best possible design.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether presidential power over monetary policy has effective limits.</p>\n\n<p>If the president can remove Fed governors by claiming cause and that claim is unreviewable, then future presidents inherit that power. A president who wants higher interest rates to fight inflation can fire governors who resist. A president who wants lower rates to stimulate growth can fire governors who disagree. The Fed becomes responsive to whoever holds office, not to any consistent standard or statutory mandate.</p>\n\n<p>The wall Congress built in 1913 was not meant to last forever unchanged. But it was meant to be removed deliberately, through legislation, not eroded through interpretations that preserve the form while eliminating the substance.</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing the president should never be able to remove Federal Reserve governors. I am arguing that if we change that 112-year-old protection, we should change it knowingly, through democratic process, not through legal claims that redefine \"cause\" until it means \"disagreement.\"</p>\n\n<p>Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush, is arguing this case for Cook and the Fed's independence. Powell himself will be in the courtroom. That tells you something about what people who have served, across administrations, understand about what is at stake.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether the president wants compliant officials. Every president does.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether monetary policy should be insulated from that desire, and whether Congress has authority to create that insulation.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to that question shapes whether we have independent institutions, or whether we have institutions that answer to whoever currently holds power.</p>\n\n<p>That question, framed clearly, is why this moment matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in the uniformed services. I worked in government agencies where oversight existed, where inspectors general mattered, where the line between the White House and prosecutorial power was not crossed because it could not be crossed without consequences.</p>\n\n<p>That line has now been crossed. Repeatedly. Openly.</p>\n\n<p>The NPR report catalogs what has happened in one year. The catalog itself is the problem. When you need a multi-section graphic essay to track the erosion of constitutional norms, you are no longer talking about policy disputes. You are talking about a different kind of government.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about partisan alignment. This is about whether the system designed in Philadelphia in 1787 can withstand a presidency that treats its constraints as suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture Assumed Restraint</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution did not anticipate a president who would fire inspectors general for doing their jobs. It did not envision a Justice Department weaponized against political opponents while the president announces his targets on social media. It did not plan for congressional majorities that would watch the executive branch seize spending authority, implement sweeping tariffs without meaningful legislative debate, and respond with silence.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders built a system of checks and balances. What they assumed, but could not guarantee, was that people in power would fear violating those checks.</p>\n\n<p>That fear is gone.</p>\n\n<p>When a president pardons those convicted of violently attacking the Capitol, he is not merely exercising constitutional authority. He is declaring that political loyalty supersedes the rule of law. When his administration defies court orders, intimidates journalists, and threatens prosecutors who investigate allies, he is testing whether the system will enforce its own rules.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the answer has been equivocal.</p>\n\n<p>## Normalization Is the Danger</p>\n\n<p>What makes this moment dangerous is not any single act. It is the speed at which the extraordinary becomes ordinary.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, the idea that the president would openly direct prosecutions of political enemies would have been unthinkable. Now it is reported as fact, cataloged alongside other actions, and the news cycle moves on.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, the systematic dismantling of public health institutions based on a cabinet secretary's personal theories would have triggered congressional investigations. Now it is policy.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, Congress would not have tolerated the executive branch unilaterally withholding appropriated funds. Now it happens, and the legislative branch shrugs.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics slip. Not through a single coup. Through a thousand small adjustments in what is considered acceptable. Through the quiet recalibration of what \"checks and balances\" means until it means very little at all.</p>\n\n<p>## The Founders Warned Us</p>\n\n<p>Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>The system was designed for people who would seek power and misuse it. What the Founders could not fully account for was a scenario where one branch of government would actively assist another in dismantling the controls meant to restrain them both.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether President Trump is popular with his base. The question is whether popularity justifies the systematic elimination of accountability mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Lincoln faced a genuine existential crisis, a civil war that threatened the nation's survival. Even then, he submitted to judicial review, accepted the legitimacy of elections during wartime, and defended the principle that no president is above the law. His suspension of habeas corpus was contested in court, debated in Congress, and ultimately constrained.</p>\n\n<p>What we face now is not a civil war. It is a claim that electoral victory grants authority to disregard institutional constraints whenever they prove inconvenient. That is not a muscular presidency. That is something else.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Is Here</p>\n\n<p>The question citizens should be asking is this: What happens when the system designed to check power assumes that those in power will respect its legitimacy?</p>\n\n<p>We are finding out.</p>\n\n<p>Federal judges issue orders. The administration ignores them. Congress holds the purse. The executive branch withholds funds anyway. Inspectors general investigate. They are fired. Journalists report. They are threatened. Scientists provide data. They are silenced.</p>\n\n<p>Each act alone might be debated on its merits. Taken together, they form a pattern. That pattern is not compatible with a government of laws.</p>\n\n<p>The midterm elections will matter. Whether Congress reasserts its constitutional role will matter. Whether courts enforce their orders will matter. Whether citizens demand accountability will matter.</p>\n\n<p>But what matters most is whether we recognize what is happening while it is happening. Whether we see the difference between legitimate policy disputes and the systematic dismantling of the mechanisms that make self-government possible.</p>\n\n<p>The architecture of the republic is still standing. The question is whether anyone is still willing to defend it.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why we must answer it now.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "headline": "When Foreign Aid Becomes Ideological Enforcement",
      "content": "<p>I spent years in government watching how programs evolve. You draft them narrowly, sell them as temporary, assure everyone they're limited in scope. Then you expand them. Then expand them again. Then the expansion becomes the baseline, and anyone questioning it is told they're overreacting to normal policy.</p>\n\n<p>That's what's happening here.</p>\n\n<p>The Mexico City policy started in 1984 as a restriction on family planning funds, roughly $8 billion. By last week, it covered all non-military foreign assistance, over $30 billion. Now it extends beyond abortion to bar funding for organizations that \"promote gender ideology\" or embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about abortion anymore. This is about using the federal purse to enforce ideological conformity on a global scale.</p>\n\n<p>## The Mechanism of Control</p>\n\n<p>The expansion works through financial coercion. Organizations abroad that want U.S. aid, whether for disaster relief, HIV treatment, maternal health, or emergency food distribution, must now pledge not to discuss abortion, not to provide gender-affirming care, not to implement DEI initiatives. The policy applies not just to NGOs but to multilateral organizations like U.N. agencies and, to some extent, foreign governments themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the operational reality. An organization in Uganda runs a cervical cancer screening program. It also provides contraception counseling that includes discussion of all options. Under the new policy, it must choose: stop counseling women about abortion, or lose funding for cancer screening.</p>\n\n<p>A clinic in Madagascar provides maternal health care in rural areas where no other services exist. It also treats transgender patients. Now it must decide whether treating those patients is worth losing the ability to provide prenatal care to hundreds of women.</p>\n\n<p>That's not protecting life. That's leveraging desperation.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>The executive branch has broad authority over foreign policy and foreign aid distribution. No one disputes that.</p>\n\n<p>But this policy raises a question that goes beyond legal authority to constitutional principle: Should the executive branch use appropriated funds to impose ideological tests on speech and association, even abroad?</p>\n\n<p>Congress appropriates money for specific purposes, public health, disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The executive branch now conditions that money not on effectiveness or accountability, but on compliance with an ideological framework that extends far beyond the stated purpose of the funds.</p>\n\n<p>When disaster strikes and the most trusted, most effective local organization cannot respond because it also provides reproductive health counseling, that's not stewardship of taxpayer funds. That's subordinating humanitarian need to political agenda.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern of Expansion</p>\n\n<p>Watch how this works. First, you establish the principle with something many Americans support, restricting abortion funding. Then you expand to all global health funding. Then to all foreign assistance. Then you add restrictions on \"gender ideology.\" Then DEI.</p>\n\n<p>Each expansion is presented as minor, clarifying, merely ensuring taxpayer dollars don't fund things Americans oppose. But the cumulative effect is a global gag rule that reaches into maternal health, HIV treatment, emergency response, and now organizational hiring and internal policies.</p>\n\n<p>Organizations will self-censor. They'll avoid serving populations, discussing topics, or implementing programs that might endanger funding. The chilling effect will extend far beyond what the policy explicitly prohibits.</p>\n\n<p>That's how control works. You don't need to enforce every provision. You just need people to fear enforcement enough that they police themselves.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent</p>\n\n<p>In 1992, the Supreme Court held in *Rust v. Sullivan* that the government could prohibit family planning clinics receiving federal funds from discussing abortion. The decision was 5-4. Justice Blackmun, dissenting, warned about \"viewpoint-based suppression of speech simply because it is carried out through the exercise of Congress's power of the purse.\"</p>\n\n<p>He was describing exactly what is happening now, but on a global scale with far broader reach.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether the executive branch can attach conditions to foreign aid. It can. The question is whether those conditions can be used to suppress speech, dictate internal organizational policies, and enforce ideological conformity on matters unrelated to the purpose of the funding.</p>\n\n<p>When aid for disaster relief is conditioned on not discussing abortion, when HIV treatment funding requires organizations to reject DEI principles, when maternal health programs must pledge not to counsel transgender patients, the conditions have become untethered from the purpose.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Means for Accountability</p>\n\n<p>Foreign aid should be accountable to outcomes. Are people being helped? Are funds being used effectively? Are programs achieving their stated goals?</p>\n\n<p>This policy shifts accountability from results to ideology. It doesn't ask whether organizations are saving lives. It asks whether they're adhering to a particular political and social framework.</p>\n\n<p>That shift matters. When government programs are evaluated on ideological compliance rather than effectiveness, the government loses the ability to distinguish between what works and what merely signals the right politics.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether you support abortion rights or oppose gender ideology. The question is whether executive power should be used to impose those positions globally through financial coercion, even when doing so undermines the stated purpose of the aid itself.</p>\n\n<p>Should the United States condition hurricane relief on organizational policies about gender? Should it bar the most effective HIV prevention programs because they implement DEI training? Should it force foreign governments to choose between American aid and their own health priorities?</p>\n\n<p>That's not foreign policy.

      "content": "<p>I watched this happen before.</p>\n\n<p>Not the specific threat, not the exact trade dispute, but the pattern. A president declares that a neighboring democracy exists at his sufferance. That its trade relationships, its foreign policy, its very sovereignty are subject to approval from Washington. That 100% tariffs, economic devastation visited on millions, can be imposed by tweet if a allied government makes decisions we dislike.</p>\n\n<p>The threat itself is extraordinary. The casualness is what matters.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump has threatened Canada with punitive tariffs because its government negotiated a trade agreement with China. Not because Canada violated a treaty obligation to the United States. Not because Canada acted contrary to established trade law. But because Canada made a sovereign decision about its own economic policy that the president believes serves Chinese rather than American interests.</p>\n\n<p>He calls Prime Minister Carney \"Governor Carney.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not political theater. That's a statement of constitutional position.</p>\n\n<p>## What Changed</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the power \"to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" Article II makes the president commander-in-chief and gives him authority to make treaties \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" Nowhere does the Constitution grant the executive unilateral authority to threaten economic warfare against treaty allies who exercise their own sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>The trade relationship in question involves the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA/USMCA), which replaced NAFTA. That agreement is binding treaty law. It contains dispute resolution mechanisms. It has scheduled reviews. It was negotiated, signed, and ratified through constitutional process.</p>\n\n<p>Trump is not proposing to invoke those mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>He is threatening unilateral action, outside treaty obligations, in response to a sovereign nation's independent trade policy. He is asserting, in effect, that Canada's freedom of action exists only to the extent that it pleases the United States. That Canadian sovereignty is provisional, subject to American approval.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers make clear what's at stake. Nearly $3.6 billion in goods and services cross the border daily. Canada supplies 60% of U.S. crude oil imports, 85% of electricity imports, and critical minerals the Pentagon considers essential to national security. A 100% tariff would devastate both economies.</p>\n\n<p>That devastation is the point. The threat is designed to compel submission.</p>\n\n<p>## The Quiet Erosion</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton warned about this in Federalist No. 75. Writing about treaty power, he noted that \"the history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind\" to the sole discretion of one person. Treaties require Senate consent, he argued, because \"the power of making treaties is plainly neither the one nor the other\" of legislative or executive power alone, but something requiring both.</p>\n\n<p>The Framers feared consolidation of authority in a single office. They designed separation of powers specifically to prevent one person from wielding the combined force of legislation, execution, and foreign policy without check or balance.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is the assertion that emergency trade authority, temporary tariff powers granted by Congress in specific contexts, can be wielded as permanent instruments of presidential will to coerce allied democracies.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about whether Canada's China deal serves American interests. Reasonable people can disagree about trade policy.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether the constitutional structure governing foreign commerce still functions. Whether treaty obligations bind. Whether Congress retains its Article I authority. Whether allies are sovereign or provincial.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern Across Borders</p>\n\n<p>Trump's threat to Canada comes while he publicly discusses annexing Greenland, absorbing Canada as a 51st state, and treating NATO allies as protectorates who exist at American discretion. At Davos, he declared \"Canada lives because of the United States.\"</p>\n\n<p>In one week, he praised Canada's China agreement, then threatened to destroy Canada's economy over it.</p>\n\n<p>The inconsistency is not confusion. It is demonstration. The message is that policy, principle, and treaty obligation matter less than presidential prerogative. That allied governments must constantly calculate not what serves their interests or honors their agreements, but what mood they might encounter from Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Prime Minister Carney responded by saying \"Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.\" That's the language of nations facing a predatory power, not the language of treaty allies within a constitutional system of law.</p>\n\n<p>Canada hosts American military installations. Canadian and American forces are integrated through NORAD. The border is defended jointly. Intelligence is shared. For three-quarters of a century, the relationship has been grounded in mutual treaty obligations and constitutional process.</p>\n\n<p>The president is asserting the right to set all that aside if a sovereign government makes a trade decision he dislikes.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Constitution Says About This</p>\n\n<p>Article VI declares that treaties are \"the supreme Law of the Land.\" They bind the president as much as they bind Congress or the states. The CUSMA is not a guideline. It is law.</p>\n\n<p>If Canada has violated that agreement, mechanisms exist to address it. If the agreement requires renegotiation, it comes up for review this year through the process specified in the treaty itself.</p>\n\n<p>Trump is not proposing to use those mechanisms. He is threatening to ignore them. To treat binding treaty law as provisional, subject to his unilateral revision based on his assessment of Canadian policy toward third parties.</p>\n\n<p>The precedent is devastating. If a president can threaten allied democracies with economic destruction for making sovereign policy choices, then treaty obligations mean nothing. Congressional authority over foreign commerce means nothing. The constitutional separation of powers means nothing.</p>\n\n<p>All that remains is presidential discretion, unchecked by law or process.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question No One Is Asking</p>\n\n<p>Here is what matters: Can the president unilaterally threaten trade war against treaty allies who exercise sovereignty in ways he dislikes?</p>\n\n<p>Not: Is Canada's China policy wise?</p>\n\n<p>Not: Does Trump's threat serve American interests?</p>\n\n<p>But: Does constitutional structure still constrain executive action, or has emergency authority become permanent power to coerce sovereign allies?</p>\n\n<p>Because if the answer is that the president can do this, then we no longer have a constitutional foreign policy. We have imperial prerogative, exercised at presidential whim, bounded only by what the president believes he can accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>Madison wrote in Federalist No. 47 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"</p>\n\n<p>Canadians are now learning what Americans are learning: that constitutional constraint, treaty obligation, and separation of powers have become negotiable. That authority asserted as temporary has become permanent. That extraordinary measures are now routine.</p>\n\n<p>The tariff threat may never be implemented. Trump may shift position again tomorrow. But the assertion has been made. The precedent is established. An allied democracy has been told its sovereignty exists at American sufferance.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is what makes this moment dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in government. I know what an after-action report looks like when officers use lethal force. I know what accountability looks like when federal agents operate on American streets.</p>\n\n<p>What happened in Minneapolis on January 24, 2026 is not that.</p>\n\n<p>## The Facts on Record</p>\n\n<p>Alex Pretti, 37 years old, intensive care nurse, U.S. citizen, no criminal record, lawful carry permit.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple videos show him holding a phone. Six federal officers tackle him. He's face down on the ground. Ten shots fired into his back.</p>\n\n<p>Federal officials immediately called him a \"domestic terrorist\" planning to \"massacre\" officers.</p>\n\n<p>The videos contradict that claim entirely.</p>\n\n<p>## This Is Not About Immigration Enforcement</p>\n\n<p>The issue here is not whether immigration law should be enforced. The issue is whether federal agents can kill an American citizen on a city street, contradict the video evidence with immediate accusations of terrorism, and then refuse to allow state investigators access to the scene.</p>\n\n<p>That's not immigration enforcement. That's something else.</p>\n\n<p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche called it a \"split-second decision\" in a \"complicated, violent situation.\" The commanding officer, Gregory Bovino, said \"the victims are the Border Patrol agents.\"</p>\n\n<p>The video shows Pretti helping someone up. Then he's tackled. Then he's shot in the back while pinned to the ground.</p>\n\n<p>A federal judge had to issue an emergency restraining order to prevent the destruction of evidence. State investigators with a lawful search warrant were blocked from a public street by federal agents.</p>\n\n<p>In a constitutional republic, when government uses lethal force, there is an investigation. There is accountability. There is transparency.</p>\n\n<p>Not here.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern Is the Problem</p>\n\n<p>This is the second fatal shooting by immigration agents in Minneapolis this month. The first victim, Renee Macklin Good, was shot while turning her car to drive away. The Trump administration announced it will not investigate that killing either.</p>\n\n<p>Between these two deaths: a 5-year-old detained, a U.S. citizen of Hmong descent dragged into his yard in his underwear at gunpoint without a warrant, legal residents swept up in what residents describe as an \"arrest-first, ask-questions-later\" approach.</p>\n\n<p>Three thousand federal agents in Minneapolis. Five times the size of the city's police force. Operating under what authority, exactly? Subject to what oversight?</p>\n\n<p>Governor Tim Walz said the federal government cannot be trusted to investigate itself in this case. A Republican senator, Bill Cassidy, broke with his party to call for a joint investigation. A former Trump administration DHS general counsel called for the president's impeachment over what he termed \"lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, a Second Amendment advocacy group, called for transparency. When gun rights advocates are questioning whether a man with a lawful carry permit can be shot for simply having that gun, something fundamental has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process. The Fourteenth applies those protections against state action.</p>\n\n<p>When federal agents kill someone on a public street and refuse to allow a state with jurisdiction to investigate, when they immediately brand the victim a terrorist despite video evidence showing otherwise, when a federal judge must intervene to preserve evidence, we are watching constitutional protections collapse in real time.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is a republic issue.</p>\n\n<p>Mayor Jacob Frey said it plainly: \"The masked militarized force and unidentified agents patrolling our streets, that is what erodes trust in both law enforcement and in democracy itself.\"</p>\n\n<p>He told residents their grandchildren would ask them what side they were on.</p>\n\n<p>That's the right question, wrong verb tense.</p>\n\n<p>Your grandchildren will ask you what you did when video evidence contradicted the government's immediate characterization of a citizen as a terrorist. When federal agents blocked state investigators from a scene. When emergency court orders were required to preserve evidence. When the Department of Justice stood by the shooting of a man face-down on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>In a free society, when government kills someone, there is an investigation. Not by the same agency that employed the shooter, but by an independent authority with the power to charge if wrongdoing occurred.</p>\n\n<p>That investigation considers the evidence. It does not begin with a conclusion that the victim was a \"domestic terrorist.\"</p>\n\n<p>If the use of force was justified, the evidence will show it. If it was not, there are consequences. That's not anti-law enforcement. That's pro-law enforcement. It's how officers who do their jobs right are distinguished from those who don't.</p>\n\n<p>What we're seeing in Minneapolis is the opposite. Federal officials announced the victim's guilt immediately. They blocked state investigators. A court had to intervene to prevent evidence destruction.</p>\n\n<p>That's not accountability. That's impunity.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>Here is the test for whether this should concern you, regardless of your views on immigration, on Trump, on any partisan consideration:</p>\n\n<p>Would you accept this outcome if the political parties were reversed?</p>\n\n<p>If a Democratic administration deployed 3,000 agents to a city, killed two citizens in a month, called them terrorists despite video evidence to the contrary, and refused to allow state investigation, would you consider that a legitimate exercise of federal authority?</p>\n\n<p>If your answer changes based on who is president, you don't have principles. You have preferences.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution doesn't change with administrations. Due process doesn't depend on the party in power. The right to accountability when government uses lethal force doesn't belong to people you agree with politically. It belongs to everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Alex Pretti was helping someone up when federal agents tackled him. He was face-down when they shot him. Ten rounds. In the back.</p>\n\n<p>The government called him a terrorist before any investigation.</p>\n\n<p>The video tells a different story.</p>\n\n<p>A judge had to order agents not to destroy evidence.</p>\n\n<p>This is where we are.</p>\n\n<p>## In Union There Is Strength</p>\n\n<p>Minneapolis activated its National Guard, not against a foreign threat but to protect residents from escalating tensions with federal agents in their own streets. Think about that.</p>\n\n<p>Residents held vigils in subzero cold. \"It can be anyone walking past this street right now,\" one told reporters. That's not hysteria. That's recognition.</p>\n\n<p>When video evidence contradicts official accounts and officials maintain their version anyway, when courts must intervene to preserve evidence, when a former administration official calls what he witnessed \"fascism,\" the question is not whether this is a problem.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether there will be accountability.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution provides mechanisms for that. State investigations. Federal courts. Congressional oversight. Public transparency.</p>\n\n<p>All of those are being resisted.</p>\n\n<p>That resistance is the story.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent two decades in uniform, some of that time in places where governments turned their militaries inward. I learned to recognize certain patterns. The internet goes dark first. Then the official death counts stay suspiciously low. Then you start hearing numbers from people on the ground, and they don't match.</p>\n\n<p>Six thousand one hundred and twenty-six people.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a protest crackdown. That's a massacre.</p>\n\n<p>The Human Rights Activists News Agency verified each death individually, working through networks inside Iran despite a comprehensive internet blackout now in its third week. The Iranian government claims 3,117 dead and calls the rest \"terrorists.\" The disparity between those numbers isn't a rounding error. It's the space where accountability goes to die.</p>\n\n<p>This started over currency collapse. Within days it became something larger, the kind of moment when a society asks whether it will continue to be governed by those who rule it. The theocracy answered with bullets. Over 41,800 people arrested. Eighty-six children dead. And an internet blackout so complete that families cannot call out, journalists cannot report in, and the world watches through the narrowest of windows.</p>\n\n<p>The United States now positions an aircraft carrier group in the region. President Trump threatens military action if mass executions proceed. Iran's proxy militias signal willingness to fight. We stand at the edge of regional war, and the predicate is this: a government killing its own people in numbers that approach civil war casualties, all while the world debates whether to intervene.</p>\n\n<p>But that debate misses the essential question.</p>\n\n<p>## What Are We Witnessing?</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Trump or American military posture or regional proxy conflicts. This is about whether the international order has any remaining capacity to respond when a government treats peaceful protest as armed rebellion and answers it with industrial-scale violence.</p>\n\n<p>The Iranian government has cut its population off from the world so thoroughly that we cannot even confirm the dead. Think about what that means. In 2026, with satellite technology and global telecommunications, a nation-state can create an informational black hole around mass killing. The blackout itself is the story—the demonstration that a government can act with such impunity that it need not even pretend to justify itself.</p>\n\n<p>When I served overseas, we briefed on rules of engagement, on proportionality, on the laws of armed conflict. Those laws exist because certain principles transcend borders: you don't massacre civilians, you don't use military force against peaceful protest, you maintain some connection between the threat faced and the force applied. Iran's government has discarded all of that. The currency collapsed, people protested, and the response was to kill them by the thousands.</p>\n\n<p>That's not law enforcement. That's war against a civilian population.</p>\n\n<p>## The Mechanics of Impunity</p>\n\n<p>The internet blackout is not incidental. It's the essential predicate to everything that follows. In a connected world, governments act differently when they know they're being watched. Remove that connectivity and you remove the external restraint. You create a space where violence can be applied without immediate consequence, where bodies can be buried before they're counted, where the official narrative has time to solidify before evidence emerges to contradict it.</p>\n\n<p>Iran has done this before, but never at this scale or duration. The 2009 Green Movement, the 2019 protests over fuel prices—both saw internet disruptions and violent crackdowns. But this is different in degree and kind. Three weeks of near-total blackout. Death tolls approaching small-war levels. A government that has stopped even pretending to distinguish between peaceful protesters and armed insurgents.</p>\n\n<p>The international architecture built after World War II was premised on the idea that sovereignty has limits, that governments cannot simply do as they please to their own populations, that the world community has some obligation to respond when mass atrocity occurs. We've watched that architecture erode for years. Now we're watching it fail in real time.</p>\n\n<p>## The Dangerous Precedent</p>\n\n<p>What concerns me most is not this crisis alone but what it establishes for the next one. Iran has demonstrated that in 2026, a government can kill thousands of its own people, cut them off from the world while doing it, and face no meaningful international response beyond diplomatic statements and the positioning of military assets that may or may not be used.</p>\n\n<p>That's a lesson other governments will learn.</p>\n\n<p>When a government can kill with this kind of impunity, when the international community proves unable or unwilling to respond except through the threat of external military force, we validate the proposition that internal sovereignty is absolute. That governments owe their people nothing. That the slaughter of civilians engaged in peaceful protest is a matter of domestic jurisdiction, regrettable perhaps but ultimately beyond the reach of international principle.</p>\n\n<p>This is how norms collapse. Not through formal treaty revision or explicit policy change, but through accumulation of examples where the stated rules don't apply. Where governments kill and face no consequence. Where the international community deploys the vocabulary of human rights but not its mechanisms. Where the choice becomes either military intervention or watching in silence, with no middle ground of meaningful accountability.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question No One Is Asking</p>\n\n<p>Here's what troubles me: We're debating whether the United States should bomb Iran. We're tracking carrier groups and parsing militia statements and gaming out regional war scenarios. All of that matters. But we're not asking the question that actually determines what kind of world we live in.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any international principle, any mechanism, any remaining norm that can respond to mass killing of civilians by their own government without requiring either military intervention or acquiescence?</p>\n\n<p>Because if the answer is no, if our only options are war or silence, then we've already conceded that sovereignty means governments can do whatever they want to their own people. We've accepted that the international order has no capacity to defend human rights except through force of arms. We've validated the proposition that power without accountability is the natural state of nations.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, determines everything that follows.</p>\n\n<p>The Iranian people are dying in the dark, cut off from the world, their deaths undercounted by their government and barely witnessed by ours. The carrier group sails toward the region. The militias prepare. And we debate military intervention while the fundamental question remains unasked: What is sovereignty worth if it means governments can massacre their people with impunity?</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if military action is justified here. I know that it's the wrong question if it's the only question. The test of our international order isn't whether we're willing to go to war over atrocity. It's whether we have any other answer when atrocity occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we don't.</p>\n\n<p>That silence, that absence of any mechanism between war and acquiescence, is what six thousand dead Iranians have revealed. The question isn't what America does next. The question is what a world looks like where this can happen and our only choices are bombs or nothing.</p>\n\n<p>The test is here.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years working in government facilities where nuclear materials were handled. The protocols were exhaustive. The documentation was redundant. The oversight was layered. And everyone understood why.</p>\n\n<p>When you're working with materials that can kill people decades after exposure, when you're securing substances that terrorists would cross oceans to obtain, when you're protecting groundwater that millions depend on, you don't streamline safety. You make it burdensome on purpose.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Energy has now rewritten over 750 pages of nuclear safety requirements, reducing them to roughly one-third of their original length. The new rules were shared with the companies being regulated. They were not shared with the public.</p>\n\n<p>That's the story.</p>\n\n<p>But the constitutional question is different. It's about who gets to know what the government is doing, and when, and why.</p>\n\n<p>## The Inversion of Accountability</p>\n\n<p>In a constitutional republic, the government is accountable to the people. Regulatory agencies exist to protect public safety, not to serve as concierge services for industry. The public has a right to know the standards that will govern activities that could affect their health, their water, their land, their lives.</p>\n\n<p>What happened here inverts that relationship.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Energy rewrote safety standards for experimental nuclear reactors. It briefed industry executives. It created \"Concierge Teams\" reporting directly to the Secretary of Energy to \"ensure expeditious processing\" of applications. It did all of this without publishing the new rules or seeking public comment.</p>\n\n<p>The new orders were legally changed because DOE directives, unlike federal regulations, can be revised internally without public notice. That's technically permissible. But constitutional governance isn't only about what's technically legal. It's about maintaining the relationship between power and accountability that makes self-government possible.</p>\n\n<p>When an agency shares new safety standards with the companies it regulates before sharing them with the public those companies might endanger, something has shifted. The question isn't whether DOE followed procedural rules. The question is: who is the government working for?</p>\n\n<p>## What Was Cut, and What That Means</p>\n\n<p>The specifics matter because they reveal the nature of what's being normalized.</p>\n\n<p>Gone is the requirement to keep radiation exposure \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable,\" a principle that has governed nuclear safety for decades at both DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The justification is economic efficiency. Workers can now receive higher doses before an investigation is triggered. Reactors can be built with less shielding. The financial burden is reduced.</p>\n\n<p>Gone is the requirement to designate a Cognizant System Engineer for each critical safety system, someone responsible for understanding every part of a reactor that could cause a catastrophic failure.</p>\n\n<p>Gone is the requirement to use \"best available technology\" to protect water supplies from radioactive discharge. The language was changed from \"prohibited\" to \"should be avoided.\"</p>\n\n<p>Gone are over 500 pages of security requirements, firearms training standards, limits on guard force working hours, specifications for physical barriers protecting nuclear material. They've been reduced to 23 pages of bullet points.</p>\n\n<p>These aren't minor adjustments to outdated bureaucracy. These are foundational safety principles developed after Three Mile Island, after decades of nuclear accidents, after careful study of what happens when protocols fail. They were written in the language of mandatory compliance: \"prohibited,\" \"must,\" \"shall.\" They have been rewritten in the language of discretion: \"should be,\" \"can be,\" \"as appropriate.\"</p>\n\n<p>That shift from mandate to suggestion is how regulatory authority quietly becomes regulatory suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Deadline That Explains Everything</p>\n\n<p>On May 23, 2025, the President signed an executive order requiring the Department of Energy to approve at least three experimental nuclear reactors \"with the goal of achieving criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4, 2026.\"</p>\n\n<p>Fourteen months to review, approve, and oversee construction of multiple untested reactor designs.</p>\n\n<p>A professor who ran DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy until 2024 called the timeline aggressive \"to say the least.\" Research reactors typically take at least two years to build after construction begins. Few have ever been built on this timescale.</p>\n\n<p>The deadline created the pressure. The pressure created the justification for speed. Speed created the justification for secrecy. And secrecy created the opportunity to rewrite safety standards away from public scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>This is how extraordinary measures become normalized. A symbolic deadline, a presidential signature, an industry eager to move fast, a regulatory structure that permits internal revision, and suddenly you have experimental reactors being built under safety standards the public hasn't seen.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is innovation. The method is opacity. And once the reactors are operational under these standards, the standards themselves become precedent.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Trust</p>\n\n<p>Christopher Hanson, who chaired the Nuclear Regulatory Commission until he was fired by President Trump in 2025, said something worth considering: \"I would argue that the Department of Energy relaxing its nuclear safety and security standards in secret is not the best way to engender the kind of public trust that's going to be needed for nuclear to succeed more broadly.\"</p>\n\n<p>He's right, but he's understating the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Public trust in nuclear power has been fragile since Three Mile Island. Every proposed reactor site faces organized opposition. Communities demand transparency, detailed safety reviews, environmental impact studies. They want to know what's being built, how it will be secured, what could go wrong, and who will be held accountable if it does.</p>\n\n<p>The regulatory process, burdensome as it is, exists partly to create that trust. It forces agencies to explain themselves. It gives citizens the opportunity to ask questions, raise concerns, point out risks the experts might have missed. The slowness itself communicates seriousness.</p>\n\n<p>Bypassing that process doesn't just risk safety failures. It guarantees trust failures. When people learn that experimental reactors are being built under secret safety standards, that the rules were shared with industry before the public, that a \"Concierge Team\" exists to speed applications through review, they will conclude that the government is working for someone else.</p>\n\n<p>And they will be right to conclude it.</p>\n\n<p>## What James Madison Would Recognize</p>\n\n<p>Madison wrote in Federalist 51 that \"the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.\"</p>\n\n<p>What's happening here is the collapse of that separation.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Energy is the regulator, the promoter, and the expediter. It writes the rules, approves the reactors, and provides concierge service to applicants. The reviewers report to the Secretary. The Secretary reports to the President. The President set a July 4 deadline for criticality. And the entire process happened without the public knowing the standards being applied.</p>\n\n<p>There's no external check. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which normally regulates commercial reactors through a rigorous public process, has been bypassed. Some NRC staff have been loaned to DOE, but they're now working under DOE's loosened standards, reporting through DOE's chain of command.</p>\n\n<p>When the regulator, the promoter, and the industry being regulated are all aligned toward the same goal, with the same deadline, under rules the public cannot see, you no longer have regulation. You have a partnership pursuing velocity.</p>\n\n<p>Madison would recognize this. It's the problem of faction he warned about in Federalist 10: when a group with a shared interest gains control of the machinery of government, they will use it to advance that interest. The cure is transparency, competing powers, public accountability.</p>\n\n<p>All of which have been suspended here.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization</p>\n\n<p>This is not about whether Small Modular Reactors are a good idea. Nuclear power may well be essential to meeting energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. There are legitimate debates about whether existing safety standards are too stringent, whether ALARA has been applied beyond what's reasonable, whether innovation is being unnecessarily delayed.</p>\n\n<p>But those are debates that should happen in public, with expert testimony, public comment, environmental review, and congressional oversight. What's happening instead is the quiet rewriting of foundational safety principles to meet a symbolic deadline.</p>\n\n<p>And once these reactors are operational, the new standards become the baseline. Future reactors will be built under these looser rules. The cuts to security requirements, environmental protections, worker safety standards, all of it becomes precedent. Temporary measures to meet an urgent deadline become permanent features of the regulatory landscape.</p>\n\n<p>That's how extraordinary measures become normalized. Not through dramatic announcements, but through quiet internal revisions that no one sees until they're already in effect.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether the Department of Energy is technically permitted to revise its internal orders without public comment. It is.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether some existing nuclear safety standards might be overly burdensome. Some might be.</p>\n\n<p>The question is this: In a constitutional republic, is it acceptable for an agency to rewrite safety standards governing experimental nuclear reactors, share those standards with the companies it regulates, and withhold them from the public?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, on what principle? What limiting standard prevents this from becoming routine? What prevents other agencies from adopting the same approach, sharing new rules with regulated industries while keeping the public in the dark?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, what recourse exists? The orders were legally revised. The executive order creating the program came from the President. The oversight agency has been bypassed. The traditional regulatory process doesn't apply. The rules won't appear in the Federal Register. Congress hasn't intervened.</p>\n\n<p>So who, exactly, is accountable?</p>\n\n<p>That's the question citizens should be asking. Not whether nuclear power is good or bad. Not whether these particular reactors will be safe. But whether a government that rewrites safety standards in secret, shares them with industry before the public, and creates concierge teams to expedite approvals is still a government of, by, and for the people.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>When the first of these reactors achieves criticality, possibly on July 4, 2026, there will be a ceremony. Officials will speak about American innovation, energy independence, technological leadership. The President may attend. It will be presented as success.</p>\n\n<p>But success measured how? By meeting a deadline? By achieving criticality? By satisfying industry partners?</p>\n\n<p>Or by protecting public safety, maintaining transparency, preserving the accountability that makes self-government possible?</p>\n\n<p>The reactors may operate without incident. The loosened security standards may prove adequate. The reduced environmental protections may cause no harm. The elimination of mandatory radiation minimization may not endanger workers. All of that is possible.</p>\n\n<p>But even if every reactor operates safely, something will have been lost. The principle that safety standards governing activities that could harm the public should be developed in public. The norm that regulated industries should not see new rules before citizens do. The expectation that government agencies work for the people, not the sectors they regulate.</p>\n\n<p>Those things, once lost, are hard to recover.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about nuclear power. It's about the quiet transfer of sovereignty from citizens to interests, from public accountability to private benefit, from transparent governance to expedited process.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength. But union requires trust. And trust requires knowing what your government is doing, and why, and for whom.</p>\n\n<p>The reactors are being built. The question is what else is being constructed alongside them.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in uniform, and later in government service, understanding one principle above all others: legitimacy flows from process, and once process concludes, we accept the result.</p>\n\n<p>That's what constitutional order requires.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, FBI agents in ballistic vests entered the Fulton County Election Hub in Georgia with a federal warrant. They loaded materials into trucks. They seized records from an election held more than four years ago. An election that was certified by Republican election officials. An election that survived hand recounts. An election whose results were upheld by dozens of courts, including judges appointed by the candidate who lost.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Justice sued Fulton County in December seeking \"all used and void ballots, stubs of all ballots, signature envelopes, and corresponding envelope digital files from the 2020 General Election.\"</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a criminal investigation into recent misconduct. This is the executive branch, now led by the candidate who disputed that election's results, deploying federal law enforcement to re-examine ballots from an election he lost.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether investigations can be legitimate. The question is what it means when a president uses the apparatus of federal law enforcement to revisit the election that made him a private citizen.</p>\n\n<p>## The Record Speaks</p>\n\n<p>The facts are not in dispute. Georgia's 2020 election was among the most scrutinized in American history. Biden won by 12,670 votes. The state conducted a hand recount of nearly five million ballots. The result held. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who supported Trump, certified the outcome. Multiple audits followed. No widespread fraud was found.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous courts rejected the legal challenges. Not on procedural grounds. On the merits.</p>\n\n<p>In a recorded phone call, the losing candidate told Raffensperger: \"I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\" Raffensperger refused. He followed the law instead of the president's instruction.</p>\n\n<p>That was January 2, 2021. Two criminal indictments followed years later, one federal, one state, both charging election interference. The federal case ended when Trump returned to office. The state case collapsed amid prosecutorial error and was dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>Now the federal government he leads has obtained a warrant to seize the materials from that election.</p>\n\n<p>This is not investigation. This is revisitation.</p>\n\n<p>## What Precedent Permits</p>\n\n<p>The law allows investigations. Federal authority extends to election fraud when it occurs. No one disputes this.</p>\n\n<p>But consider what is being normalized.</p>\n\n<p>A candidate loses an election. He disputes the result publicly and through litigation. Courts reject his claims. State officials certify the outcome. He faces criminal charges for his efforts to overturn it. Those charges end when he regains power. Then his Department of Justice obtains warrants to seize the records of that same election, citing the same fraud claims that courts previously rejected.</p>\n\n<p>This is not partisan. It is procedural.</p>\n\n<p>What prevents the next administration from doing the same? What prevents any losing candidate, once returned to power, from deploying federal law enforcement to investigate the election they lost? If a warrant can be issued years later, on claims already adjudicated, when does an election truly end?</p>\n\n<p>Finality is not a courtesy. It is a constitutional requirement. Without it, no transition of power is legitimate. Without it, every election remains provisional, subject to reopening when power shifts.</p>\n\n<p>In Federalist No. 68, Hamilton wrote that the election process must be designed so \"the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\" But he also understood that process must conclude. Elections are not永久 pendente lite.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>Fulton County Commissioner Mo Ivory stood outside the election facility and said, \"This is an assault on your vote.\"</p>\n\n<p>That framing is incomplete. The question is not whether this targets one party's voters. The question is whether it targets the finality of elections themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Ask this: If a future president who lost Georgia in 2024 returns to office in 2032, may that president's Justice Department obtain warrants to seize 2024 ballots, citing fraud claims rejected by courts in 2025? If the answer is yes, elections are never final. If the answer is no, explain the principle that distinguishes this case.</p>\n\n<p>Ask this: Does a warrant's existence prove an investigation's legitimacy, or does legitimacy depend on what the investigation seeks to prove and why it is being conducted years after courts resolved the underlying claims?</p>\n\n<p>Ask this: When federal agents in tactical gear enter local election offices to seize years-old materials, who is being investigated? The ballots, or the outcome?</p>\n\n<p>The legal authority to investigate does not answer whether the investigation serves law or power. Courts authorize warrants based on probable cause. They do not assess whether reopening settled questions undermines constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>## The Framers' Warning</p>\n\n<p>The Founders knew that power, once exercised, becomes precedent. They built the Constitution to constrain not just what government does, but what it can justify doing later.</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist No. 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" We rely on institutional restraint because we cannot rely on leaders to restrain themselves.</p>\n\n<p>When institutional norms erode, they do not collapse suddenly. They erode through individual acts that seem defensible in isolation but accumulate into precedent. A warrant is issued. Materials are seized. The process is legal. But the pattern is dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about 2020. It is about what becomes permissible in 2032, 2040, 2048. It is about whether elections, once certified and litigated and recounted, remain closed, or whether they remain subject to federal investigation whenever the losing candidate later gains federal power.</p>\n\n<p>## What We Are Witnessing</p>\n\n<p>An election was held. It was certified. It was audited. It was litigated. It was recounted. Courts ruled. The outcome stood. The losing candidate faced charges for attempting to overturn it. He regained office. His Justice Department now deploys federal law enforcement to seize the materials from that election.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a neutral act. It is a statement about what elections mean. If they can be reopened when power shifts, they are not democratic contests. They are provisional arrangements, subject to ratification by the next administration's investigators.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the republic the Founders designed. That is not the system their Constitution protects. That is not compatible with the peaceful transfer of power.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether today's warrant is legally defensible. The test is whether we accept that elections, once concluded, remain open to federal investigation by the candidates who lost them, once those candidates return to power.</p>\n\n<p>If we accept that, we have accepted that elections never truly end. We have accepted that legitimacy flows not from voters and courts, but from whoever controls the FBI.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years working in roles where respecting sovereignty wasn't an abstract principle. It was operational discipline. When you work across borders, in uniform or in civilian capacity, you learn that nations hold together through shared commitment, not just geography. And you learn that outside powers who encourage internal fracture are not acting as friends.</p>\n\n<p>That's why the meetings between Alberta separatists and U.S. officials deserve attention beyond the partisan noise.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether Alberta has legitimate grievances with Ottawa. Regional tensions exist in every federal system. That's not unusual.</p>\n\n<p>What's unusual is a Treasury Secretary publicly calling a Canadian province \"a natural partner\" while separatists conduct what they call \"feasibility studies\" on half-trillion-dollar credit lines with officials in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>The White House says no commitments were made. Perhaps. But the meetings themselves are the message. They signal that dissolution is being treated as a respectable option, not a constitutional crisis. They suggest that one nation's internal democratic processes are proper subjects for another nation's strategic planning.</p>\n\n<p>That crosses a line that used to be bright.</p>\n\n<p>**The Pattern of Encouraged Fragmentation**</p>\n\n<p>History offers clear lessons here. Outside powers rarely encourage separatist movements from altruistic motives. They do so when they perceive advantage in weakening a neighbor or rival.</p>\n\n<p>Russia funded separatists in Ukraine. It supported movements in Georgia, Moldova, the Balkans. China courts Pacific island nations while their larger neighbors watch. The playbook is consistent: identify internal divisions, offer external support, present dissolution as empowerment.</p>\n\n<p>The United States has historically opposed such tactics when aimed at allies. We supported Canadian unity during Quebec's referendums. We backed territorial integrity in Europe after the Cold War. The principle was clear: nations decide their own composition through their own democratic processes, without foreign interference.</p>\n\n<p>What changed?</p>\n\n<p>The answer appears to be that strategic interest now outweighs principle. Alberta has resources. An independent Alberta might be more compliant on pipelines, energy exports, continental security. The calculation is transparent.</p>\n\n<p>But the calculation ignores what happens when major powers treat allied nations' unity as negotiable based on resource access.</p>\n\n<p>**Sovereignty and Democratic Process**</p>\n\n<p>Prime Minister Carney's response, telling U.S. officials to \"respect Canadian sovereignty,\" states the principle plainly. So does Alberta Premier Smith's expectation that the U.S. leave discussions of provincial status to Canadians.</p>\n\n<p>Both statements recognize something fundamental: the legitimacy of democratic choice depends on it being made freely, by the people it affects, without outside interference.</p>\n\n<p>If Albertans genuinely wish to explore independence, that's their right through Canadian constitutional processes. But when a neighboring power offers financial backing and political encouragement, the decision is no longer wholly theirs. The thumb is on the scale.</p>\n\n<p>This matters beyond Canada. If the United States can support separatism in a close ally based on resource interests, what prevents other powers from doing the same elsewhere? What prevents them from doing it here?</p>\n\n<p>Consider: if China offered financial backing to a Hawaiian independence movement, or Russia supported Texas separatists, would we call that respecting democratic choice? Or would we call it what it is—strategic interference in another nation's integrity?</p>\n\n<p>The principle doesn't change based on whose sovereignty is being undermined.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether Alberta separatism is justified or likely. Polling suggests most Albertans oppose it. The counter-petition gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the United States government should be meeting with and encouraging separatist movements in allied democracies at all.</p>\n\n<p>Because if the answer is yes—if strategic advantage justifies undermining allied unity—then we've abandoned a principle that has served both democracy and stability since 1945.</p>\n\n<p>We've accepted that sovereignty is conditional, that territorial integrity is negotiable, that outside powers may properly interfere in other nations' internal democratic processes when it serves their interests.</p>\n\n<p>That's not the position of a nation that respects the rule of law. That's the position of an empire managing provinces.</p>\n\n<p>**The Test of Principle**</p>\n\n<p>There's a reason the Founders worried about foreign influence. They understood that outside powers offering support rarely do so to strengthen self-governance. They do so to create dependencies, to gain leverage, to turn internal divisions into external opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Madison wrote in Federalist 43 about the necessity of preventing foreign interference in domestic affairs. Hamilton warned repeatedly about entangling alliances that compromised sovereignty. Both understood that free government requires insulation from external pressure.</p>\n\n<p>The principle applies universally. When we encourage separatism in allied nations for strategic gain, we weaken not just their sovereignty but the entire framework that makes sovereignty meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>And we invite others to do the same to us.</p>\n\n<p>British Columbia's Premier Eby used strong language, calling such meetings \"treason.\" That may overstate the legal case. But it captures the moral one.</p>\n\n<p>Citizens who seek outside support for dissolving their nation aren't acting in pure democratic spirit. They're inviting foreign influence into a fundamentally internal question.</p>\n\n<p>And officials who provide that support aren't respecting democracy. They're exploiting it.</p>\n\n<p>**What Remains**</p>\n\n<p>The meetings happened. The Treasury Secretary spoke. The signals were sent.</p>\n\n<p>What matters now is whether this becomes accepted practice or recognized as a boundary crossed.</p>\n\n<p>If democratic allies cannot rely on each other to respect their territorial integrity, then alliances mean nothing. If outside powers may properly encourage internal dissolution based on resource interests, then sovereignty becomes mere theater.</p>\n\n<p>The question for American citizens is whether we want our government conducting itself this way. Whether we believe our strategic interests justify undermining allied unity. Whether we think other nations won't reciprocate.</p>\n\n<p>Because they will.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Alberta or Canada specifically. It's about whether there are still limits to what powerful nations do to weaker neighbors, even friendly ones.</p>\n\n<p>If there aren't, say so clearly.</p>\n\n<p>If there are, then these meetings should not have occurred, and the officials who held them should hear from citizens that encouraging allied dissolution crosses a line.</p>\n\n<p>That's not politics. That's principle.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "headline": "When Amnesty Becomes Permission",
      "content": "<p>The news from Venezuela is being framed as reconciliation. That framing is worth examining.</p>\n\n<p>President Nicolás Maduro's government has announced an amnesty bill that could release political prisoners, some held for years without trial, others convicted in proceedings international observers described as show trials. The timing matters. The announcement comes after contested elections, after street protests met with lethal force, after the Organization of American States documented systematic repression.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't clemency. This is theater.</p>\n\n<p>I watched something similar in another context, years ago. A government announces it will release prisoners it never should have detained. International community applauds. The coverage focuses on individual stories of reunion, of families made whole. Those stories are real. The suffering was real. But the larger pattern escapes notice.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is this: imprison without due process, release with conditions, repeat.</p>\n\n<p>**What Amnesty Means**</p>\n\n<p>Amnesty is a curious legal instrument. In its purest form, it erases the legal consequences of past acts. The crown pardons the rebel. The revolutionary government pardons the collaborator. The nation tries to move forward.</p>\n\n<p>But what happens when amnesty becomes a regular feature of governance?</p>\n\n<p>When detention without trial leads to release without accountability, something shifts in the constitutional order. The question is not whether specific individuals deserve freedom. The question is whether a system that routinely imprisons people for political speech and then periodically releases them qualifies as a legal system at all.</p>\n\n<p>Article 68 of Venezuela's constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest. Article 44 prohibits detention without charges beyond forty-eight hours. Article 49 guarantees due process and the presumption of innocence. These are not suggestions. They are supposed to be binding law.</p>\n\n<p>Yet Venezuela's Bolivarian National Intelligence Service has held opponents for months without trial. Military tribunals have convicted civilians. Opposition leaders have been barred from seeking office based on administrative decrees rather than criminal conviction.</p>\n\n<p>And now, amnesty.</p>\n\n<p>**The Cycle of Arbitrary Power**</p>\n\n<p>Here's what this pattern establishes: the government's power to imprison is unreviewable, and its power to release is discretionary.</p>\n\n<p>That's not law. That's sovereignty without constraint.</p>\n\n<p>I served under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It's strict, sometimes harsh, but it operates by rules. Charges must be specified. Evidence must be presented. The accused has counsel. Convictions can be appealed. The system exists to constrain power as much as to impose discipline.</p>\n\n<p>What Venezuela demonstrates is government by gesture rather than by law. Detain when politically useful. Release when diplomatically convenient. The individual lives and liberties involved are instrumental. They serve the state's purposes.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned about this in Federalist 47. He wrote that the accumulation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers in the same hands \"may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" Venezuela's chavista government writes the laws, enforces them, and controls the courts that review them. Maduro's amnesty doesn't restore rights. It demonstrates their absence.</p>\n\n<p>Rights that can be suspended and restored at will are not rights. They are privileges. And a people who live by privilege rather than law are not citizens. They are subjects.</p>\n\n<p>**The International Dimension**</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela's announcement comes amid renewed diplomatic engagement. The United States has eased some sanctions. Regional governments have reopened channels. The amnesty reads like a concession offered in exchange for recognition.</p>\n\n<p>But examine what is being recognized. Not a constitutional order. Not rule of law. Not due process. Instead, the international community is accepting that Venezuela operates on a different system, one where detention and release happen outside legal structures, and stability matters more than accountability.</p>\n\n<p>This is how autocracy gets normalized. Not through conquest, but through accommodation.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Maduro's government deserves diplomatic engagement. Pragmatism sometimes requires dealing with governments we find repugnant. The question is whether that engagement should proceed as if amnesty substitutes for constitutional government.</p>\n\n<p>It does not.</p>\n\n<p>When the United States recognizes a government that imprisons opponents without trial and releases them without legal process, we are recognizing power, not legitimacy. That distinction matters. It matters for how we understand our own constitutional commitments. It matters for what we model to the world.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>Here is the question: Can a government that routinely violates constitutional protections, then periodically suspends enforcement without accountability, claim to operate under law?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is no. What Venezuela has is not rule of law but rule by decree masked in legal language.</p>\n\n<p>A second question: What does it mean when democracies treat that as normal?</p>\n\n<p>It means we have accepted that some nations operate on different principles, that for them, constitutional government is aspirational rather than binding. It means we have moved from defending a universal standard to negotiating levels of acceptable repression.</p>\n\n<p>Franklin wrote, after the Constitutional Convention, that the founders had given America \"a Republic, if you can keep it.\" The keeping is in the vigilance. It's in refusing to treat arbitrary power as normal, even when it happens elsewhere. It's in understanding that rights guaranteed but not enforced are not rights at all.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela's amnesty will free specific people. That is good. Those individuals and their families deserve reunion. But the system that imprisoned them remains intact. The mechanisms of repression endure. And the next time political pressure mounts, those mechanisms will be deployed again.</p>\n\n<p>Because amnesty without accountability is not reconciliation. It's intermission.</p>\n\n<p>**The Constitutional Question**</p>\n\n<p>This matters beyond Venezuela. It matters because the pattern is visible elsewhere. Governments detain under emergency powers that never expire. Courts defer to executive authority in the name of stability. Opposition is redefined as threat. And periodic releases are treated as evidence of liberalization rather than as proof that the initial detentions were lawless.</p>\n\n<p>That's not politics. That's the erosion of the distinction between law and power.</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath had no expiration date. Part of defending constitutional government is recognizing when it's absent. Venezuela's amnesty reveals a government that exercises power without legal constraint, where detention and release happen at the discretion of officials rather than through processes of law.</p>\n\n<p>That's tyranny with paperwork.</p>\n\n<p>The test for a constitutional order is not whether it occasionally releases those it has imprisoned. The test is whether it can imprison them lawfully in the first place. Venezuela fails that test. And when democratic nations treat its amnesty as evidence of progress rather than as confirmation of lawlessness, we fail a test of our own.</p>\n\n<p>We fail to insist that the difference between law and power still matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have read thousands of legal orders. I have never read one that ends with the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ordered the release of five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father from ICE detention in Texas. At the bottom of his ruling, beneath the legal citations and factual findings, he included a photograph of the boy. Below it, two verses: \"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'\" And below that: \"Jesus Wept.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not legal argument. That's witness.</p>\n\n<p>When a federal judge abandons the customary language of jurisprudence to invoke the moral vocabulary of faith, something has shifted. The question is not whether you agree with his decision. The question is: what does a judge see that compels him to speak this way?</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Quotas</p>\n\n<p>Judge Biery wrote that the case \"has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.\"</p>\n\n<p>Daily quotas. Three thousand immigration arrests per day, according to White House Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller. Not targets. Not goals. Quotas.</p>\n\n<p>This is how enforcement becomes detached from judgment. When authority operates according to numerical mandates rather than individual circumstances, the system ceases to evaluate and begins to process. The machinery runs to meet the quota. The five-year-old with the Spider-Man backpack becomes a unit counted toward the daily number.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about immigration policy. This is about what happens when law becomes logistics.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution does not permit the executive branch to set numerical goals for deprivations of liberty and then work backward to justify them. That is the definition of arbitrary power: deciding how many people to detain, then finding reasons to detain that many people.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Biery described it as \"ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented.\" The more precise term is unconstitutional. You cannot quota your way to due process.</p>\n\n<p>## When Process Becomes Theater</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security disputes the neighbors' account that agents used Liam to lure his mother to the door. DHS says the father fled on foot and left the boy in a running vehicle in the driveway.</p>\n\n<p>Set aside which version is accurate. Focus on what both versions reveal.</p>\n\n<p>In one account, federal officers use a kindergartener as bait. In the other, they detain a kindergartener left in a driveway and transport him to a family detention center in Texas where, according to his father's testimony to members of Congress, the boy is \"frequently tired and not eating well.\"</p>\n\n<p>Neither version describes the actions of a government operating within constitutional constraints. Both versions describe a system optimized for numbers, not justice.</p>\n\n<p>The administrative state has developed an entire vocabulary to make this sound normal. Detention. Processing. Removal. These are not euphemisms. They are the language of bureaucracy performing the function of sorting human beings into categories for efficient handling.</p>\n\n<p>When a five-year-old becomes a case file in a quota system, the law has stopped protecting liberty and started merely justifying process.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Judge Saw</p>\n\n<p>Judge Biery is not a recent appointee navigating contemporary political pressures. He was appointed by President Clinton in 1994. He has served for more than thirty years. He has written thousands of orders in the measured, bloodless prose of federal jurisprudence.</p>\n\n<p>He looked at this case and wrote: \"Jesus Wept.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is the sound of a judge who has seen something he cannot reconcile with the rule of law. Not the technical rule of law—the citation of precedent, the application of statute, the weighing of competing interests. The foundational rule of law: that government power exists to secure rights, not to meet quotas.</p>\n\n<p>He also wrote that \"apparent also is the government's ignorance of an American historical document called the Declaration of Independence,\" suggesting the administration's actions echo the grievances against King George III.</p>\n\n<p>A federal judge is accusing the executive branch of conduct that resembles the tyranny that justified American independence. That is not partisan rhetoric. That is a warning.</p>\n\n<p>## The Dilley Facility</p>\n\n<p>The South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas houses approximately 1,100 people. Detained families report worms in food, poor access to clean water, inadequate medical care. In December, ICE acknowledged holding about 400 children longer than the recommended limit of 20 days.</p>\n\n<p>These are not allegations from advocacy groups. These are facts acknowledged by the agency itself.</p>\n\n<p>The facility reopened in 2025 after previous closures. It reopened to meet demand. The demand is not a function of border crossings. The demand is a function of quotas.</p>\n\n<p>When you set a target of 3,000 arrests per day, you need facilities to hold the people you arrest. The facilities fill. Conditions deteriorate. Children sleep in their fathers' arms because they are not eating well.</p>\n\n<p>This is what it looks like when policy becomes arithmetic.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question That Isn't Being Asked</p>\n\n<p>The public debate centers on whether enforcement is too aggressive or not aggressive enough. That is the wrong debate.</p>\n\n<p>The right question is: can a free society operate immigration enforcement according to daily quotas?</p>\n\n<p>Not \"should we enforce immigration law?\" We enforce immigration law. The question is whether enforcement can be quota-driven and still remain lawful enforcement, or whether quota-driven enforcement is by definition arbitrary—a system that decides how many people to detain and then reverse-engineers the justifications.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution does not permit the government to say, \"We will arrest 3,000 people today\" and then go find 3,000 people to arrest. That is not law enforcement. That is a roundup.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>The quota is the proof we are not governed by angels. It is also the proof that internal controls have failed.</p>\n\n<p>## What Happens Next</p>\n\n<p>The judge ordered Liam and his father released by Tuesday. The government has not indicated whether it will comply or appeal.</p>\n\n<p>But the larger question is what happens to the system that produced this case. Does it change, or does it continue processing people toward numerical targets? Do we ask how many five-year-olds are acceptable collateral damage in pursuit of 3,000 arrests per day, or do we ask whether the quota itself is compatible with constitutional governance?</p>\n\n<p>A federal judge quoted the Bible in a legal order because the language of law was insufficient to name what he was witnessing. That insufficiency is the warning.</p>\n\n<p>When judges start writing scripture, it means the law has been asked to justify something it cannot justify. When a government sets quotas for deprivations of liberty, it has stopped governing and started administrating. When a five-year-old ends up in a detention center as a unit in a daily count, the machinery has replaced the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>That boy is home, or will be by Tuesday. The quota remains.</p>\n\n<p>That's the test.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in government service. I learned early that the distance between what authority claims to do and what it actually does is where liberty dies.</p>\n\n<p>In Minneapolis, federal agents are arresting lawful refugees in their homes. Not criminals. Not people who violated the terms of their admission. Refugees who passed FBI checks, biometric screenings, multiple interviews. People granted protection under U.S. law because they fled persecution.</p>\n\n<p>The administration says it's investigating fraud. The arrests tell a different story.</p>\n\n<p>## The Claim and The Reality</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security announced on January 9 that it would re-examine thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota. The stated purpose: investigating potential fraud. The unstated reality: more than 100 refugees with no criminal record have been arrested, many transported to Texas detention facilities, held without explanation, then released.</p>\n\n<p>A federal judge found these arrests were made \"without warrants or cause.\"</p>\n\n<p>This isn't an investigation. This is a show of force dressed as process.</p>\n\n<p>When J.J.'s family opened their door to ICE agents who said they needed to verify his son's fingerprints, who promised he would not be detained, they were told what countless Americans have been told throughout history: trust the process, comply with authority, everything will be fine.</p>\n\n<p>Then they watched their son handcuffed and driven away in a black SUV.</p>\n\n<p>Three days later he was released. No charges. No explanation for his arrest. No explanation for his release.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>Here's what should alarm every American, regardless of immigration views: the government is using an obscure statute that allows detention of people with pending green card applications, then deploying that authority not to process applications but to relitigate approved refugee cases.</p>\n\n<p>Immigration attorney Luke Srodulski represents a woman who was detained, sent to Texas, brought back to Minnesota, then interrogated for seven hours about her entire refugee claim. She has diabetes. She didn't have her medication for two days. After this ordeal, having found no fraud, the government approved her green card.</p>\n\n<p>This is what administrative cruelty looks like.</p>\n\n<p>The statute DHS is invoking (8 U.S.C. § 1159) was never intended as an investigatory tool. It exists to facilitate processing. The administration has repurposed it as a detention mechanism, a way to hold people while searching for a reason to hold them.</p>\n\n<p>That's not law enforcement. That's fishing with human beings as bait.</p>\n\n<p>## What Lawful Status Means</p>\n\n<p>Refugees are not undocumented immigrants. They are not visa overstays. They entered the United States through the most rigorous vetting process in our immigration system. They were interviewed multiple times, in multiple countries. Their stories were corroborated. Their identities verified.</p>\n\n<p>Jane Graupman, who runs the refugee resettlement agency in Minnesota, calls them \"probably the most vetted population that comes to the United States.\" The FBI already checked them. Immigration services already checked them. They've had biometric screenings.</p>\n\n<p>They have lawful status.</p>\n\n<p>When government arrests people with lawful status, holds them without cause, interrogates them about cases already decided, then releases them without explanation, it is not enforcing law. It is demonstrating that law protects only those who enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Venezuelan Family's Fear</p>\n\n<p>A. told reporters that watching her son arrested reminded her of Venezuela, where paramilitary groups loyal to the government would kidnap young men. Some never came back.</p>\n\n<p>\"In Venezuela, pro-government paramilitary groups act this way,\" she said. \"They cover their faces, you can only see their eyes.\"</p>\n\n<p>She fled that country to escape that fear.</p>\n\n<p>Now she feels it in Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p>This is what we should measure: not whether enforcement is vigorous, but whether it creates in lawful residents the same fear they fled. When people who followed every rule, passed every screening, received formal protection under U.S. law experience the knock on the door at dawn, the guns drawn, the son driven away without explanation, we are not enforcing law. We are enforcing terror.</p>\n\n<p>## The Judge's Finding</p>\n\n<p>U.S. District Judge John Tunheim issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, halting these arrests. His language was precise: refugees cannot be arrested \"without warrants or cause.\"</p>\n\n<p>He wrote: \"At its best, America serves as a haven of individual liberties in a world too often full of tyranny and cruelty. We abandon that ideal when we subject our neighbors to fear and chaos.\"</p>\n\n<p>A federal judge had to order the government to stop arresting lawful residents without warrants.</p>\n\n<p>Let that settle.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We're Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>The administration claims it's investigating fraud. Fine. Fraud should be investigated. But investigation doesn't require mass detention. It requires evidence gathering, focused interviews, subpoenas if needed. When you arrest more than 100 people, fly them to another state, hold them for days, then release nearly all of them without charge, you're not investigating. You're sending a message.</p>\n\n<p>The message is: lawful status is provisional. Documentation is provisional. Yesterday's refuge is today's target.</p>\n\n<p>That's not immigration enforcement. That's the normalization of arbitrary power.</p>\n\n<p>The question we should be asking is not whether the administration has authority to review refugee cases. It does. The question is whether that authority includes arresting people who have committed no crime, holding them without stated cause, transporting them across state lines, interrogating them about cases already decided, withholding their medication, and releasing them only after a federal court intervenes.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to that question defines what kind of country we are.</p>\n\n<p>## What Changes Quietly</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this pattern before, in different contexts. Authority claims an emergency. It invokes a statute. It takes extraordinary action. The action becomes routine. The statute becomes precedent. The emergency becomes permanent.</p>\n\n<p>In Minneapolis right now, federal agents are knocking on doors before dawn, arresting refugees who opened those doors in good faith, believing they had nothing to fear because they had done everything right.</p>\n\n<p>That belief, in law as protection rather than process, is what's being shattered.</p>\n\n<p>When refugees with lawful status fear ICE as much as they once feared the regimes they fled, something fundamental has shifted. Not in law, not yet. But in the lived reality of what law means.</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned that the accumulation of all powers in the same hands is the definition of tyranny. He didn't specify that those powers had to be exercised all at once, or with dramatic announcements. Often they accumulate quietly, through the repurposing of existing statutes, through the redefinition of existing authorities, through the steady expansion of what government claims it can do without a warrant, without probable cause, without anything but its own assertion of necessity.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration says it will not stand idly by as the immigration system is weaponized. But weaponization is not what refugees do. It's what this enforcement pattern represents: the use of immigration law not to process cases fairly but to create fear in communities, to demonstrate reach, to show that documentation and lawful status provide less protection than power.</p>\n\n<p>Beth Grosen's Lutheran church sponsored the single mother who was detained, sent to Texas, brought back, interrogated for seven hours, then approved for her green card. After the woman's sudden arrest, the church had to find somewhere for her son to stay. They sent money for phone calls. The daycare where she works had no idea when she'd return.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's ripples throughout our community when crazy things like this happen,\" Grosen said.</p>\n\n<p>Those ripples are the point.</p>\n\n<p>When refugees with lawful status learn that documentation doesn't protect them, that compliance with all requirements doesn't protect them, that even judicial approval of their cases doesn't protect them, the lesson spreads. Authority is not bound by law. Authority is law.</p>\n\n<p>That lesson, once learned, doesn't unlearn easily.</p>\n\n<p>The test before us is whether we accept this. Whether we accept that refugees granted protection under U.S. law can be arrested without warrants, held without cause, interrogated about cases already decided, then released without explanation or apology. Whether we accept that an investigation of fraud can proceed through mass detention rather than focused inquiry. Whether we accept that lawful status means only what the enforcement agent standing at your door says it means that morning.</p>\n\n<p>A federal judge has said no. For now, the arrests have paused. The question is what happens when the pause lifts, when the case resolves, when the next emergency requires the next extraordinary measure.</p>\n\n<p>The distance between refuge and target is smaller than we think. It's measured not in statute or precedent but in the willingness of citizens to ask why people who followed every rule, passed every check, received every approval are being arrested in their homes before dawn.</p>\n\n<p>That question, persistently asked, is why judges issue restraining orders and why constitutions constrain power.</p>\n\n<p>That question, ignored, is why they stop.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have served in positions where decisions are made under statutory authority. I have signed documents that affect people's lives. I have sat in rooms where the question is whether the law permits an action, and I know what it looks like when someone has already decided the answer and is simply looking for legal cover.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Ana Reyes wrote that Secretary Kristi Noem \"preordained her termination decision\" and acted \"because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants.\" That is the language of a court finding bad faith. Not error. Not policy disagreement. Bad faith.</p>\n\n<p>That matters.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether Temporary Protected Status has been extended too many times. It's about whether executive power can be wielded as a weapon of prejudice while claiming the shield of statutory discretion.</p>\n\n<p>**The Structure Congress Built**</p>\n\n<p>Congress created Temporary Protected Status in the Immigration Act of 1990. The statute is clear: the Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a country for TPS when conditions there, whether from armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances, make return unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The word is \"may.\" That grants discretion.</p>\n\n<p>But discretion is not carte blanche. It is authority bounded by law, by fact, and by the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. An official may exercise discretion. An official may not exercise animus.</p>\n\n<p>Haiti received TPS designation in 2010 after an earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and left the capital in ruins. The designation was extended repeatedly, most recently in 2021, because conditions in Haiti remain catastrophic. Gang violence controls much of Port-au-Prince. The government lacks basic capacity. Humanitarian organizations describe the situation as dire.</p>\n\n<p>That is the factual predicate for continued protection.</p>\n\n<p>Secretary Noem called TPS recipients \"killers, leeches, or entitlement junkies.\" Judge Reyes quoted those words in an 83-page opinion. They are part of the evidentiary record. They reveal not a policy judgment but a characterization of human beings based on national origin.</p>\n\n<p>That is not discretion. That is prejudice wielding power.</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Accountability**</p>\n\n<p>The administration argues that TPS has been \"abused\" by prior administrations, that it attracts illegal immigration, that Congress intended it to be temporary and it has become permanent.</p>\n\n<p>Those are policy arguments. They deserve debate. They do not justify terminating protection based on animus rather than conditions in Haiti.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Reyes found it \"substantially likely\" that the decision was preordained and discriminatory. That finding is not a final judgment, but it is enough to halt deportation while the case proceeds. The court applied the standard test: likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, balance of equities, public interest.</p>\n\n<p>The plaintiffs are five Haitian TPS holders. They are among more than 350,000 people whose lives were set to change overnight, not because Haiti became safe, but because someone in power decided their presence was no longer tolerable.</p>\n\n<p>One day before the termination was to take effect, a federal judge said: Not yet. Not like this. Not without law and fact on your side.</p>\n\n<p>That is the judiciary performing its constitutional function. It is the check on executive power that the Founders designed precisely for moments when authority is exercised arbitrarily.</p>\n\n<p>**When Temporary Authority Persists**</p>\n\n<p>The administration is also moving to terminate TPS for migrants from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Venezuela. Some of these countries are in active armed conflict. Some are under authoritarian regimes. Some lack basic state capacity.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is clear: a wholesale dismantling of protections, not country by country based on changed conditions, but as a category, as a matter of policy preference framed as statutory interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>That is how temporary authority becomes normalized. You take a discretionary power, apply it categorically, and claim you are merely returning to original intent. You do not evaluate conditions in Kabul or Caracas. You evaluate whether the program itself should exist, and you use statutory language as cover for what is effectively a legislative repeal by executive action.</p>\n\n<p>Congress created TPS. Congress can end it. What Congress has not done is delegate to the executive the power to terminate protection based on hostility to the protected class rather than assessment of country conditions.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction is not semantic. It is constitutional.</p>\n\n<p>**The Historical Echo**</p>\n\n<p>In 1944, the Supreme Court upheld the internment of Japanese Americans in *Korematsu v. United States*. The government argued military necessity. The Court deferred. Decades later, we acknowledged what should have been obvious: the decision was driven by racial animus, not security needs.</p>\n\n<p>The Court formally repudiated *Korematsu* in 2018, but the lesson remains: when government wields extraordinary power against a disfavored group and claims statutory or emergency authority, the question is not whether the statute permits the action. The question is whether the action is pretextual.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Reyes is asking that question now.</p>\n\n<p>This is not apocalyptic. It is procedural. But procedure is how republics preserve liberty. When a court says \"show me the facts, show me the law, show me that this decision was not preordained by prejudice,\" that is not judicial activism. That is judicial duty.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether you support or oppose TPS. The question is whether executive officials can terminate protection for hundreds of thousands of people based on characterizations like \"killers, leeches, or entitlement junkies\" rather than on statutory criteria and country conditions.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then discretion has no bounds. If the answer is no, then the judiciary's intervention is not obstruction but accountability.</p>\n\n<p>There are more than 350,000 Haitian TPS holders in the United States. They have work authorization. They have built lives. Many have been here for more than a decade. Their status was always temporary, but temporary does not mean arbitrary. It does not mean subject to termination by officials who have expressed contempt for them as a class.</p>\n\n<p>Congress can change the law. The administration can present evidence that conditions in Haiti have improved. What cannot happen, in a republic governed by law, is the exercise of statutory discretion as a vehicle for animus.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Reyes has said: Prove your case. Show that this is about Haiti, not about Haitians.</p>\n\n<p>That is the test.</p>\n\n<p>The answer will define whether authority in this country is still bounded by constitutional principle, or whether \"temporary\" powers, once granted, can be wielded without constraint against those who lack the political power to resist.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The documents came down quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Thousands of pages related to Jeffrey Epstein's case, unsealed and made public, then removed after victims were identified within them. The stated reason: protecting those who suffered. The legal mechanism: legitimate privacy concerns. The practical effect: evidence of how power operated returns to shadow.</p>\n\n<p>This is not conspiracy theory. This is how institutional protection works when the choice is between transparency and trauma, between the public's right to know and individuals' right to dignity.</p>\n\n<p>The choice is real. The tension is genuine.</p>\n\n<p>But we should name what else happens when that choice is made.</p>\n\n<p>**What Gets Preserved, What Gets Erased**</p>\n\n<p>I have read declassified documents. I have watched what happens when a government decides certain information threatens more than it illuminates. Sometimes the decision is correct. Sometimes it merely convenient.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is consistent: what protects the vulnerable can also protect the powerful. What shields victims from further harm can shield perpetrators from full accounting.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein case is extraordinary not because powerful people do terrible things, they always have, but because the machinery of justice briefly became visible. We saw how wealth purchases access. How access becomes immunity. How immunity, once granted, is rarely revoked.</p>\n\n<p>The flight logs. The property records. The financial transfers. The names.</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, the architecture of impunity was on public display.</p>\n\n<p>Then it wasn't.</p>\n\n<p>**The Problem Isn't the Victims**</p>\n\n<p>Let's be precise about what we're discussing.</p>\n\n<p>Victims of sexual abuse have a right to privacy. That right is not theoretical. It is grounded in dignity, in the recognition that being victimized once does not mean being displayed forever. Courts routinely redact victim identities. This is settled law. This is correct practice.</p>\n\n<p>But the Epstein documents contain more than victim testimony.</p>\n\n<p>They contain evidence of who knew what, who facilitated what, who benefited from what. They contain the operational details of how an alleged sex trafficking network functioned across state lines and international borders. They contain information about people who were neither victims nor prosecutors but something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>When all of that goes down with the victim identities, what exactly are we protecting?</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether victims deserve privacy.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the legitimate need to protect victims is being used to limit what the public can know about how power operated.</p>\n\n<p>**Accountability in Darkness**</p>\n\n<p>Here is what I know from years in government: sunlight is not always disinfectant. Sometimes it is merely glare. Sometimes the public exposure of wrongdoing changes nothing except who gets embarrassed.</p>\n\n<p>But secrecy has its own costs.</p>\n\n<p>When the full record of Epstein's connections, his patterns, his protections remains partially sealed, we cannot fully understand how the system failed. We cannot identify which institutions need reform. We cannot answer the question that matters most: Could this happen again?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is yes, it could. It probably is.</p>\n\n<p>Because the mechanisms that enabled Epstein, wealth purchasing access, access becoming influence, influence becoming immunity, those mechanisms are still operating. They operate in darkness. They always have.</p>\n\n<p>Transparency doesn't guarantee accountability. But opacity guarantees its absence.</p>\n\n<p>**What Madison Would Recognize**</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned that power, once granted, seeks to perpetuate itself. He did not mean only governmental power. He meant any concentration of influence that could bend public institutions to private ends.</p>\n\n<p>In Federalist 51, he wrote: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein case is not about government in the narrow sense. But it is absolutely about whether our institutions, courts, prosecutors, regulators, can be bent by private power. Whether the law applies differently depending on who you know. Whether justice is a principle or a commodity.</p>\n\n<p>Madison would recognize what we're seeing. Not the specific crime. But the pattern. Power protecting itself. Institutions accommodating rather than challenging. The machinery of accountability running in neutral.</p>\n\n<p>**The Question We're Not Asking**</p>\n\n<p>We are asking: Should victim identities be protected?</p>\n\n<p>Yes. Obviously. Without qualification.</p>\n\n<p>We are not asking: Who decided that protecting victims required removing everything?</p>\n\n<p>That question has an answer. Someone made a choice about what constituted necessary redaction versus excessive secrecy. Someone decided the entire document set should come down rather than releasing carefully redacted versions. Someone determined that the risk of victim identification outweighed the public interest in understanding how this network functioned.</p>\n\n<p>Who made those determinations? Under what standard? Subject to what review?</p>\n\n<p>These are not rhetorical questions. They have specific answers. Those answers matter.</p>\n\n<p>Because the choice between protecting victims and ensuring accountability is real. But it is also being made by people with interests, perspectives, and pressures we cannot see.</p>\n\n<p>Transparency about the process of becoming opaque would be a start.</p>\n\n<p>**Where This Leaves Us**</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein documents will remain partially sealed. Victim privacy will be protected. These are good things.</p>\n\n<p>But we will not know the full extent of what occurred. We will not see the complete network of who knew, who helped, who looked away. We will not have the record necessary to prevent the next wealthy predator from operating with similar impunity.</p>\n\n<p>Some of that is unavoidable. Privacy and transparency genuinely conflict. Rights clash. Reasonable people disagree about where lines should be drawn.</p>\n\n<p>But some of it is choice. And the choice benefits those who would prefer the machinery of power remain invisible.</p>\n\n<p>I have no solution that preserves every principle. Neither does anyone else. We are managing tensions, not resolving them.</p>\n\n<p>But we can be honest about the cost.</p>\n\n<p>When documents that reveal how power operates return to darkness, even for legitimate reasons, accountability becomes harder. Reform becomes less urgent. The incentive to change decreases.</p>\n\n<p>And the powerful remain protected by the very measures meant to protect their victims.</p>\n\n<p>That's not conspiracy. That's structure.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether we are satisfied with the choice, or whether we demand something more: redaction without erasure, privacy without impunity, protection for victims that does not become protection for perpetrators.</p>\n\n<p>That question, still unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "headline": "When Treaties End",
      "content": "<p>On Thursday at midnight, a 15-year treaty called New START expired. With it went the last formal limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time in more than fifty years, the world's two largest nuclear powers operate without binding constraints on their weapons, without mutual inspections, without the notification systems that, for a generation, prevented miscalculation.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about arms control theory. This is about the architecture of survival.</p>\n\n<p>I served during the Cold War. I remember what it meant to live under the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, to know that human civilization existed at the sufferance of two governments who had agreed, formally and verifiably, not to pursue nuclear supremacy. The treaties that governed that balance weren't gestures of trust. They were acknowledgments of reality: that without limits, fear drives expansion, expansion drives countermeasures, and the logic of security becomes the logic of annihilation.</p>\n\n<p>New START was a modest treaty. It limited deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 per side, down from Cold War peaks near 12,000. But the treaty's real value wasn't in the numbers. It was in the transparency. Over its fifteen-year life, the United States and Russia exchanged more than 25,000 notifications about weapons movements. Inspectors visited each other's missile bases, bomber facilities, submarine ports. Each side knew, with reasonable certainty, what the other possessed and where.</p>\n\n<p>That certainty is gone.</p>\n\n<p>## What Happens When Guardrails Disappear</p>\n\n<p>The White House says President Trump will \"clarify\" the path forward \"on his own timeline.\" Russia's Kremlin spokesman warns of a \"more dangerous world.\" Both statements are true. But they obscure the deeper question: what happens to a strategic balance built on verification when verification ends?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is that both sides begin planning for worst-case scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>Russia's President Putin offered a one-year informal extension of New START's limits last fall. The Trump administration has not responded. The reason offered: any new agreement must include China, whose nuclear arsenal is smaller but rapidly expanding. China has shown no interest in trilateral negotiations. And so the United States waits for a condition that will not be met, while the treaty that existed expires.</p>\n\n<p>This is how constraints end: not through deliberate choice, but through the insistence on terms that cannot be satisfied.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth asking what we are trading away. The treaty didn't prevent either side from modernizing its arsenal. The United States is already spending roughly a trillion dollars over the next decade to upgrade its nuclear weapons, submarines, and delivery systems. Russia is doing the same. What the treaty prevented was an open-ended race with no agreed endpoint, no mutual visibility, and no mechanism to prevent misunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>Christine Wormuth, a former Secretary of the Army, warns that the United States could find itself in \"an unconstrained nuclear arms race with both Russia and China at the same time.\" That race would cost money the country does not have. It would divert resources from conventional forces that face real, immediate threats. And it would occur in an environment where neither adversary knows with certainty what the other is building.</p>\n\n<p>## The Logic of Worst-Case Planning</p>\n\n<p>Here is what military planners do when they lack reliable intelligence about an adversary's capabilities: they assume the worst. They plan for maximum threat. And because the other side is doing the same, both sides build not to match each other's actual arsenals, but to counter the arsenals they fear the other might build.</p>\n\n<p>That is not strategy. That is physics.</p>\n\n<p>During the Cold War, this dynamic nearly destroyed the world several times. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, U.S. military commanders didn't know that Soviet forces on Cuba had tactical nuclear weapons and the authority to use them. In 1983, a Soviet early warning system falsely detected an American missile launch; the officer on duty chose not to report it, because he suspected a malfunction. In both cases, decisions made in uncertainty, under pressure, with incomplete information, determined whether civilization survived the hour.</p>\n\n<p>The treaties that followed those near-misses weren't idealistic. They were a recognition that without transparency, without agreed limits, without mechanisms to verify compliance, human judgment becomes the only safeguard against catastrophe. And human judgment, operating in fear and ignorance, has a poor record.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Means for a Free Society</p>\n\n<p>Here is the question citizens should be asking: what kind of country conducts foreign policy by letting treaties expire while waiting for conditions that will not be met?</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about partisan outcomes. A Democratic administration might have handled this differently, or it might not. The issue is what happens when strategic decisions are made through inaction, when the status quo shifts not because a choice was made but because a choice was deferred.</p>\n\n<p>There is an accountability problem here. The executive branch controls treaty negotiations. The Senate ratifies treaties but has no power to force the executive to negotiate. And so the question of whether the United States will have a nuclear arms control framework becomes a question the president may answer \"on his own timeline,\" which is to say, or not answer at all.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a republic makes decisions about civilizational survival.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 51 that the structure of government must furnish \"auxiliary precautions\" against the concentration of power. Treaties are one such precaution: they bind future administrations, create expectations, require justification before abandonment. When treaties expire through inattention rather than decision, when one branch of government declines to act and no other branch can compel action, the auxiliary precautions fail.</p>\n\n<p>President Reagan used to say, \"Trust, but verify.\" That phrase became shorthand for arms control in the 1980s. It meant that peace did not require trusting Soviet intentions; it required verifiable limits on Soviet capabilities. New START was a verification mechanism. It told us what Russia had, where it was, and when it moved. Now we no longer know those things.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether Americans understand what was lost, and whether they consented to losing it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>The experts quoted in this story—arms control professionals, former negotiators, nuclear strategists—agree that the immediate risk is not a new arms race. Russia is fighting a war in Ukraine. It lacks the resources for a crash nuclear buildup. The United States is modernizing the arsenal it has. Neither side will wake up tomorrow and triple its warhead count.</p>\n\n<p>But \"immediate\" is the wrong timeframe.</p>\n\n<p>The question is what happens over years, as both sides build without limits, without transparency, without the habit of notification and inspection. The question is what happens when a new crisis emerges—and it will—and neither side knows with certainty what the other can do. The question is whether the mechanisms that prevented nuclear war during the Cold War can be casually discarded because a new treaty requires conditions China will not meet.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a hypothetical. History shows what happens when great powers abandon arms control during periods of rising tension. In the years before World War I, European powers engaged in a naval arms race that poisoned diplomacy, drained treasuries, and made war seem inevitable. By the time diplomats tried to step back, the logic of worst-case planning had taken over. The weapons that were built to prevent war became the reason war, once started, could not be stopped.</p>\n\n<p>We are not there yet. But the direction is clear.</p>\n\n<p>Treaties don't guarantee peace. But they create the conditions in which peace remains possible. They build transparency. They establish expectations. They give diplomats something to work with when crises emerge. When they expire, those conditions weaken. And when they expire through inaction rather than decision, when they lapse because one side insisted on terms the other would not meet, the responsibility for what follows becomes impossible to assign.</p>\n\n<p>That is the moment we are in. Not the start of a new arms race, but the end of the framework that prevented one.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The talks are scheduled. Iran and the United States will meet in Oman on Friday. The location was contested. The scope was disputed. Regional allies intervened to keep the negotiations alive.</p>\n\n<p>But here is what matters: the president of the United States told a foreign leader he should be \"very worried\" while military forces mass in the region, and this is now how American diplomacy operates.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a critique of this administration's Iran policy. This is a question about how republics conduct foreign relations.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in uniform understanding the distinction between diplomatic authority and military threat. Treaties were debated in the Senate. Military action required congressional authorization except in immediate defense. The Founders built these separations because they understood that concentrated war powers in a single executive was the fastest path from republic to empire.</p>\n\n<p>The framework mattered because it forced deliberation before commitment, accountability before escalation, and public debate before the nation's blood and treasure were spent.</p>\n\n<p>That framework is gone.</p>\n\n<p>## The Expansion Hiding in Plain Sight</p>\n\n<p>President Trump references strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during \"a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last June.\" American forces conducted these strikes. Congress did not authorize them. The War Powers Resolution was not invoked. The public learned of the action through press reports and presidential interviews.</p>\n\n<p>These were acts of war conducted without the constitutional process for declaring war.</p>\n\n<p>The administration now uses those strikes as the baseline for further threats: \"We found out about it. I said, 'You do that, we're going to do very bad things to you.'\"</p>\n\n<p>This is coercion through military supremacy. It may be effective. But it is not constitutional governance.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Iran poses a threat. The question is whether a republic prosecutes threats through constitutional process or through executive decree backed by military force.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in 1793: \"The power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature.\" He was speaking directly against executive warmaking, warning that it was \"the true nurse of executive aggrandizement.\"</p>\n\n<p>We now call what Trump did a \"limited strike,\" not a war. We call ongoing military operations \"force posture,\" not mobilization. We say congressional authorization is unnecessary because operations fall below some threshold of sustained conflict.</p>\n\n<p>This is how war powers expand: by redefining war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization of Threats as Diplomacy</p>\n\n<p>The Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, insists that negotiations must address \"the range of their ballistic missiles, sponsorship of terrorist organizations, nuclear programme, and treatment of their own people.\"</p>\n\n<p>Iran's foreign minister says only the nuclear programme is negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>In prior eras, this would be an impasse requiring diplomatic patience, coalition-building, and strategic incentives to bring parties toward common ground. Now it is an impasse met with carrier groups, drone shootdowns, and presidential warnings delivered through broadcast interviews.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what has been normalized: a president publicly warning a foreign leader to be \"very worried\" while conducting talks. Military buildups as negotiating tactics. The implicit threat of strikes hanging over diplomatic discussions.</p>\n\n<p>This is not diplomacy backed by strength. This is force barely constrained by diplomacy.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitutional Convention debated whether to give Congress the power to \"make war\" or \"declare war.\" They chose \"declare\" specifically to preserve the executive's ability to \"repel sudden attacks.\" That distinction mattered. It meant the president could defend but not initiate, could respond but not choose war.</p>\n\n<p>We have reversed that structure. The president now initiates. Congress responds, sometimes, weakly, if at all.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Are Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>Here is the question that should be at the center of every Iran discussion but is not: under what legal authority are American forces conducting military operations against Iran?</p>\n\n<p>Not whether Iran deserves it. Not whether the strikes were tactically successful. Not whether they serve strategic goals.</p>\n\n<p>Under what constitutional or statutory authority is this happening?</p>\n\n<p>The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force targeted those responsible for 9/11 and associated forces. Iran was not responsible for 9/11. The 2002 AUMF authorized force in Iraq. It did not authorize strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>\n\n<p>So where is the authority?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is \"inherent executive power to defend national security,\" then we have abandoned constitutional limits on war powers entirely. Every action can be justified under that standard. Every president can define the threat and launch the response.</p>\n\n<p>This is not theoretical. The Human Rights Activists News Agency documents 6,445 confirmed protester deaths in Iran's recent crackdown. Trump said \"we've had their back.\" That is admirable moral support. But if military action follows, if American forces are ordered into operations to support regime change because protesters deserve freedom, under what authority does that happen?</p>\n\n<p>Supporting human rights is not a legal authorization for war.</p>\n\n<p>The Iranian government is brutal. Its nuclear ambitions are concerning. Its regional activities destabilize neighbors. None of that changes the constitutional question: who decides when America goes to war?</p>\n\n<p>The Founders answered: Congress decides.</p>\n\n<p>We have let that answer fade.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern That Demands Recognition</p>\n\n<p>This is not unique to Iran. American forces operate in Syria without congressional authorization. In Somalia. In Yemen. Across the Sahel. The executive claims authority under aging AUMFs, or inherent defensive powers, or international coalition agreements.</p>\n\n<p>Each operation is limited. Each is justified by immediate necessity. None triggers the constitutional process for declaring war.</p>\n\n<p>And so war powers transfer from the legislature to the executive one \"limited operation\" at a time.</p>\n\n<p>That transfer is permanent until challenged. These operations do not sunset. These precedents do not expire. The next administration inherits the expanded authority and adds its own operations, and the cycle continues.</p>\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin was asked what the Convention had created. He answered: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Keeping it means maintaining the structures that constrain power. It means insisting that wars require congressional authorization even when presidents promise quick victories. It means rejecting the logic that urgent threats justify bypassing constitutional process.</p>\n\n<p>Friday's talks in Oman matter. They may prevent escalation. They may produce an agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear program.</p>\n\n<p>But the talks happen under the shadow of military strikes already conducted without congressional debate, with threats of more delivered through television interviews, with American forces deployed under authorities stretched far beyond their original scope.</p>\n\n<p>That shadow is the constitutional crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Not whether Iran gets a nuclear weapon. Whether America remains a republic that decides war through representative process or an executive state that makes war through presidential decree.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not in Oman on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>The test is here.</p>",

Both arrived in response to statements by an American president about \"owning\" territory belonging to a NATO ally.</p>\n\n<p>Until this week, only Iceland and the United States maintained consular services in Greenland.</p>\n\n<p>Now there are four.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Greenland's strategic value, though the Arctic matters. This is not about Trump's rhetoric, though words from presidents carry weight. This is about what happens when allies begin responding not to actions taken, but to intentions voiced. When diplomatic infrastructure expands not because of policy shifts, but because of uncertainty about whether rules still bind.</p>\n\n<p>That shift, quiet as a flag being raised, marks something.</p>\n\n<p>## The Geography of What Was Assumed</p>\n\n<p>I've served in regions where the difference between a consulate and its absence measured not just convenience but confidence. A consulate signals commitment. It creates presence. It establishes that a nation considers a place worthy of permanent attention, permanent investment, permanent relationship.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, Canada planned no such presence in Nuuk despite sharing cultural bonds, despite the hour flight from Iqaluit to Nuuk, despite the Inuit connections Simon spoke of. The consulate was announced in early 2024 during a routine Arctic policy review. Opening was scheduled for late 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Then an American president repeatedly stated the United States needs to \"own\" Greenland for national security reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The opening moved forward. France accelerated its timeline. Both nations arrived with their most senior officials. Canada sent its Crown representative, its foreign minister, its Coast Guard. Fifty Canadian Inuit chartered a plane from Montreal to attend.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Greenland has strategic importance. The question is whether allied nations now feel compelled to establish diplomatic presence in each other's territories as a hedge against what their most powerful ally might do.</p>\n\n<p>That's new.</p>\n\n<p>## What Treaties Assume</p>\n\n<p>The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in 1949, established NATO on a principle stated clearly in Article 5: an attack on one ally is an attack on all. But the treaty assumes more than mutual defense. It assumes that allies do not threaten territorial integrity of other allies. It assumes borders remain settled. It assumes that when a member nation speaks of \"owning\" another member's territory, the statement represents rhetorical excess, not policy exploration.</p>\n\n<p>Those assumptions, never codified because they seemed foundational, now require testing.</p>\n\n<p>When Trump walked back his comments, he did not retreat to settled principle. He said he is \"exploring a potential deal\" with Denmark, European allies, and Canada regarding Greenland. A deal. As if sovereignty of NATO allied territory might be negotiable. As if Denmark's relationship with Greenland, established through democratic process and international law, might be subject to American veto.</p>\n\n<p>Greenlanders protested with signs reading \"GREENLAND IS NOT FOR SALE.\" Their prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, met with Simon not to discuss hypothetical transfers but to receive assurance that some allies still recognize Greenland's right to determine its own future.</p>\n\n<p>That such assurance now requires consulates, delegations, and public ceremony indicates how much has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization of Uncertainty</p>\n\n<p>Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, told reporters that Canadian Inuit \"worry that the United States may return to its more serious overtures around annexing Canada and Canada being the 51st state.\" He added that Inuit Nunangat, the Inuit homeland spanning northern Canada, may be \"one of the pivotal reasons for the US to consider that sentiment.\"</p>\n\n<p>Read that again.</p>\n\n<p>A representative of indigenous peoples within a NATO ally is expressing concern about American annexation of their homeland. Not as historical grievance. As present worry.</p>\n\n<p>This is what normalization looks like. Not sudden conquest, but the gradual expansion of what statements are considered serious enough to warrant defensive response. Trump's comments about Canada as the 51st state were widely treated as trolling, bluster, negotiating theater. Yet Obed worries about \"more serious overtures.\" Yet Canada accelerates Arctic infrastructure spending. Yet the Prime Minister promises year-round military presence in the far north.</p>\n\n<p>When does theater become policy? When does rhetorical exploration become negotiating position? When does a statement dismissed as unserious become serious enough that allies build consulates against it?</p>\n\n<p>The line keeps moving, and each movement is justified as merely responding to the previous one.</p>\n\n<p>## What We Are Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>The coverage of Canada and France opening consulates has focused on Arctic strategy, infrastructure gaps, climate change opening northern passages. All true. All important. All beside the deeper point.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether the Arctic matters strategically.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether territorial integrity of democratic allies is now subject to pressure from the United States, and whether other allies must respond with diplomatic infrastructure to signal that some borders remain inviolable.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a question about geography. That is a question about constitutional order among free nations. About whether treaties bind or merely suggest. About whether sovereignty of democratic peoples can be overridden by the strategic preferences of a stronger power.</p>\n\n<p>Canada's foreign minister called Arctic defense \"an unquestionable national security priority.\" But the threat she is defending against is not Russia or China. It is uncertainty about whether the United States still honors the principle that NATO allies do not acquire each other's territories, regardless of strategic justification.</p>\n\n<p>If that principle is now questionable, then every border between democratic nations becomes potentially negotiable. Every alliance becomes conditional. Every treaty becomes a suggestion pending the strategic calculations of the strongest party.</p>\n\n<p>That is not alliance. That is hegemony dressed in the language of partnership.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>Governor General Simon stood in Nuuk and participated in a ceremony that would have been unremarkable five years ago: opening a consulate in a neighbor's territory. Now it carries weight as a statement about whose sovereignty matters, whose self-determination deserves defense, whose borders remain settled.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that such a statement needed making is the story.</p>\n\n<p>Not the consulate. The necessity of it.</p>\n\n<p>When allies must establish formal presence to signal that they will not acquiesce to territorial demands that have not yet been formally made, we are testing whether free nations govern themselves or whether they govern themselves only until a stronger power objects.</p>\n\n<p>That test does not announce itself with invasion or annexation. It announces itself with repeated statements that shift from unthinkable to negotiable. With justifications based on security needs that could apply anywhere. With questions about whether weaker allies adequately defend their territory, as if inadequate defense justifies stronger allies claiming it.</p>\n\n<p>The people of Greenland, population 56,000, face no invasion. They face something more subtle: the suggestion that their status might be subject to deal-making by larger powers, that their self-determination might be conditional on someone else's assessment of their strategic importance.</p>\n\n<p>Free people should refuse that suggestion. Allies should stand with them in refusing it.</p>\n\n<p>Canada and France, by opening consulates in Nuuk, have done so.</p>\n\n<p>The question remaining is whether they needed to.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The United States wants the war in Ukraine to end by June.</p>\n\n<p>Not because a principle has been vindicated. Not because aggression has been answered. Not because the question of territorial integrity has been resolved in a way that preserves international order.</p>\n\n<p>By June. Because of midterm elections in November.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in government service. I know how decisions are made. I know the difference between strategy and scheduling. What Zelensky revealed this weekend is not a strategy. It is a deadline imposed by domestic political convenience, announced while Russian missiles strike Ukrainian power plants and civilians sleep in metro stations to survive the night.</p>\n\n<p>This is what it looks like when peace becomes a deliverable rather than a principle.</p>\n\n<p>## The Negotiation Under Bombardment</p>\n\n<p>The United States has invited both parties to Miami for talks next week. Russia launches 400 drones and 40 missiles at Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Friday night. On Saturday, we discuss the meeting schedule.</p>\n\n<p>The sequence matters.</p>\n\n<p>Russia is not negotiating. Russia is demonstrating that it can inflict suffering at will, that it can freeze Ukrainian civilians in their homes, that the cost of resistance can be raised until resistance becomes impossible. The attacks are not military operations. They are designed to break will. The tenth massive attack on DTEK power plants since October 2025. More than 220 attacks on thermal power plants since the invasion began nearly four years ago.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is clear: destruction as diplomacy.</p>\n\n<p>And the United States sets a deadline of June because of election cycles.</p>\n\n<p>This is not realism. This is the substitution of political expediency for strategic coherence. It treats the question of whether territorial conquest through force will be accepted in the 21st century as a problem to be managed on a timeline convenient to American domestic politics.</p>\n\n<p>## The Principle at Stake</p>\n\n<p>When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the question was never merely about Ukraine's borders. The question was whether the international order established after 1945, codified in the UN Charter, affirmed by every American president since Truman, would hold.</p>\n\n<p>Article 2(4) of the UN Charter: \"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\"</p>\n\n<p>That principle either matters or it does not.</p>\n\n<p>If it matters, then territorial concessions extracted under bombardment represent the invalidation of that principle. If it does not matter, then we should say so plainly and stop pretending that international law constrains aggression.</p>\n\n<p>The United States led the creation of that order. We insisted on it. We have invoked it to justify our own actions for eight decades. Either we believe that territorial integrity is inviolable except through mutual consent, or we believe that power determines borders and the strong do what they will.</p>\n\n<p>There is no middle position that preserves the principle while accommodating its violation for political convenience.</p>\n\n<p>## What June Means</p>\n\n<p>Zelensky understands what June means. He said it explicitly: domestic issues in the United States will have an impact. Midterm elections could shift the balance of power in Congress. The deadline is not about conditions on the ground in Ukraine. It is about conditions in American polling data.</p>\n\n<p>This is how principles die. Not through open repudiation, but through quiet adjustment to political timelines. Not through debate about whether territorial conquest should be accepted, but through pressure to reach \"a deal\" before the political window closes.</p>\n\n<p>I have watched this process before. I watched extraordinary authorities become routine. I watched temporary measures become permanent. I watched the language of necessity replace the language of law. It does not happen dramatically. It happens through small accommodations, each justified by circumstance, until the principle is unrecognizable.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening now is the normalization of coercion as a legitimate basis for settlement. Russia maintains military pressure, strikes civilian infrastructure, inflicts maximum suffering, and the negotiating process continues as if this were ordinary statecraft rather than the methodical destruction of the distinction between war and peace.</p>\n\n<p>If agreements reached under sustained attack on civilian populations are treated as legitimate, then we have established that sufficient violence produces international recognition of conquest. That precedent will not be limited to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Accountability</p>\n\n<p>To whom is this policy accountable?</p>\n\n<p>Not to Ukraine, which is being told that American political convenience determines how long it may resist aggression.</p>\n\n<p>Not to the principle of territorial integrity, which is being subordinated to electoral calculation.</p>\n\n<p>Not to the broader international order, which depends on the credibility of the proposition that conquest will not be recognized.</p>\n\n<p>The policy is accountable only to the domestic political needs of an administration that wants a \"win\" before voters go to the polls. That is not foreign policy. That is the sacrifice of principle to political branding.</p>\n\n<p>The question citizens should be asking is this: If territorial conquest through sustained military assault becomes acceptable when ratified by pressure for a negotiated settlement, what constraint remains on the use of force to redraw borders?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is none, except the ability to inflict sufficient cost that resistance becomes unsustainable.</p>\n\n<p>That is not an international order. That is interstate anarchy with a veneer of diplomatic process.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals</p>\n\n<p>In 1938, Chamberlain returned from Munich announcing \"peace for our time.\" The peace lasted eleven months. The principle sacrificed was that territorial demands backed by threats of force would be resisted. The accommodation of that principle did not prevent war. It delayed resistance until the cost became vastly greater.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an exact parallel. History does not repeat with precision. But the pattern is recognizable: the subordination of principle to the desire for a settlement, any settlement, that allows political leaders to claim success and move on.</p>\n\n<p>The test of principle is whether it holds when it is inconvenient. The test of international order is whether it constrains power when power does not wish to be constrained. The test of American leadership is whether we defend the rules we claim to uphold when defending them requires sustained commitment without a convenient timeline.</p>\n\n<p>We are failing all three tests.</p>\n\n<p>Russia strikes power plants while we schedule meetings. Ukraine buries its dead while we calculate midterm impacts. The principle that territorial integrity matters erodes while we discuss whether talks should occur in Miami or Abu Dhabi.</p>\n\n<p>This is not diplomacy in service of principle. This is the simulation of diplomacy while the principle is abandoned.</p>\n\n<p>## The Obligation of Witness</p>\n\n<p>I write this not as a partisan of any faction in Ukraine, Russia, or the United States. I write as someone who took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, which rests on the proposition that legitimacy derives from law, not from force. That proposition either applies internationally or it applies nowhere.</p>\n\n<p>If we accept that borders can be redrawn through military assault ratified by exhaustion and political timelines, then we have accepted that might determines right. We cannot then claim that law binds the powerful. We cannot invoke international norms when they serve our interests and discard them when they become inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Ukraine should negotiate. Sovereign nations determine their own course. The question is whether the United States will condition its support on territorial concessions that validate the use of force, and whether we will impose that condition according to our electoral calendar rather than according to any strategic or moral principle.</p>\n\n<p>That question has been answered. The answer is yes. The deadline is June.</p>\n\n<p>The citizens sleeping in Kyiv metro stations tonight know what that means. The principle of territorial integrity knows what that means. The leaders watching to see whether conquest yields recognition know what that means.</p>\n\n<p>Whether the American people understand what that means remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have served in government. I know what lawful authority looks like.</p>\n\n<p>This is not it.</p>\n\n<p>Jimmy Lai, a 78-year-old newspaper publisher, has been sentenced to 20 years in a Hong Kong prison for \"conspiring with foreign forces\" and publishing \"seditious articles.\" The government claims this has nothing to do with press freedom. They say he used journalism as a \"pretext\" to commit crimes against China and Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<p>Read that again. Publishing criticism of the government is now a pretext for criminality.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Jimmy Lai's politics. This is about what happens when law becomes merely the procedural justification for silencing dissent.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>In 1644, John Milton wrote to the English Parliament: \"Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.\" He understood something fundamental: legitimate government derives its power from the consent of the governed, and consent requires the ability to speak, to criticize, to publish without fear.</p>\n\n<p>Hong Kong once understood this too. Article 27 of its Basic Law guaranteed freedom of speech and press. The judiciary was independent. Habeas corpus meant something.</p>\n\n<p>Then came the National Security Law in 2020, imposed by Beijing without consultation with Hong Kong's legislature or people. The law created new crimes: secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. Maximum penalty: life imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Jimmy Lai was arrested within weeks.</p>\n\n<p>That was five years ago. He has been in custody ever since, much of it in solitary confinement. His newspaper, Apple Daily, shut down in 2021 after authorities froze its assets and arrested its leadership. Hong Kong has fallen from 18th to 140th in global press freedom rankings.</p>\n\n<p>The judges who convicted Lai were handpicked by the government under the security law's provisions. His trial was closed to international observers. The evidence against him included meetings with American officials and articles critical of Beijing's policies.</p>\n\n<p>This is what it looks like when process replaces justice.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization of Extraordinary Power</p>\n\n<p>The National Security Law was presented as temporary, necessary, targeted. It would address specific threats to public order. It would not affect ordinary Hong Kongers going about their lives.</p>\n\n<p>This is always how it begins.</p>\n\n<p>Emergency powers are granted. Temporary authorities are established. Special courts are created. And then the temporary becomes permanent, the targeted becomes universal, and the emergency becomes the ordinary way of governing.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the trajectory:\n- 2020: National Security Law imposed to address \"terrorism\" and \"foreign interference\"\n- 2021: Apple Daily closed, its assets seized before any trial\n- 2024: 47 pro-democracy figures sentenced for \"subversion\" for holding a primary election\n- 2026: Jimmy Lai sentenced to 20 years for publishing a newspaper</p>\n\n<p>Each step was presented as lawful. Each prosecution followed proper procedure. Each sentence was announced by judges in robes, citing statutes and precedents.</p>\n\n<p>But legitimacy is not the same as legality. A law can be on the books and still be unjust. A court can follow procedure and still deliver tyranny.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned in Federalist 47: \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands... may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" The National Security Law places all these powers in Beijing's hands, with Hong Kong authorities serving as instruments of enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test of a Free Society</p>\n\n<p>Here is the question citizens should be asking but are not: Can you have a free society where criticizing the government is a crime?</p>\n\n<p>Not a question of policy preference. Not a debate about tactics. A fundamental question about what makes a society free.</p>\n\n<p>In a free society, the government answers to the people. That requires the people to know what the government is doing. That requires a press capable of investigating, publishing, criticizing without fear of imprisonment or worse.</p>\n\n<p>Jimmy Lai's newspaper was not subtle. It was fierce, partisan, sometimes inflammatory. It called Chinese leaders by unflattering names. It advocated for democracy in Hong Kong and supported protesters in the streets.</p>\n\n<p>None of this should be a crime.</p>\n\n<p>The government says Lai \"colluded with foreign forces\" by meeting with American officials and advocating for sanctions. But seeking foreign support for democratic reform is not treason. It is politics. It is what publishers and activists do in free societies.</p>\n\n<p>The government says his articles were \"seditious.\" But sedition laws exist to prevent violent overthrow, not to silence criticism. When publishing unfavorable opinions about government policy becomes sedition, the law has become an instrument of tyranny.</p>\n\n<p>## What History Shows Us</p>\n\n<p>In 1735, John Peter Zenger, a New York printer, was tried for seditious libel after his newspaper criticized the royal governor. The jury acquitted him despite clear instructions from the judge that truth was no defense to publishing criticism of the government.</p>\n\n<p>The jury understood something the court did not: truth must be a defense, or there can be no free press. Criticism must be permitted, or there can be no free government.</p>\n\n<p>That principle became embedded in American constitutional law. \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" Not because the Founders loved newspapers, but because they understood that legitimate government requires accountability, and accountability requires the freedom to criticize without fear.</p>\n\n<p>Hong Kong is moving in the opposite direction. With each prosecution, each conviction, each closure of a newspaper or arrest of an editor, the space for criticism shrinks. What was once Asia's freest press is becoming a echo chamber for Beijing's approved narrative.</p>\n\n<p>And the international community watches, issues statements of concern, and does little else.</p>\n\n<p>## The Quiet Erosion</p>\n\n<p>President Trump mentioned Lai's case to Xi Jinping and asked him to \"consider his release.\" The British government called the prosecution \"politically motivated.\" Australia expressed grave concern.</p>\n\n<p>These are the appropriate diplomatic responses. But they reveal something uncomfortable: Jimmy Lai's fate will be decided not by law or justice, but by political calculation in Beijing. Will releasing him cause more problems than keeping him imprisoned? Will the diplomatic cost exceed the domestic benefit of silencing a prominent critic?</p>\n\n<p>This is not how justice works in free societies. In free societies, you cannot be imprisoned for 20 years because the government finds your newspaper inconvenient. In free societies, publishers are protected by law, not at the mercy of political convenience.</p>\n\n<p>Lai's daughter said if the sentence is carried out, her father \"will die a martyr behind bars.\" She is probably right. At 78, with health problems and 20 years ahead of him, Jimmy Lai is unlikely to survive his sentence.</p>\n\n<p>The Hong Kong government celebrates this outcome. The police superintendent called it \"great satisfaction to the people.\" But which people? The ones who can no longer read independent news? The journalists who fled Hong Kong to avoid arrest? The citizens who now self-censor their conversations for fear of prosecution under the security law?</p>\n\n<p>This is not the satisfaction of justice. This is the satisfaction of power unchecked by law.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Means for Constitutional Order</p>\n\n<p>Hong Kong's transformation holds lessons for anyone who cares about constitutional government and limited power.</p>\n\n<p>First: emergency powers, once granted, are rarely relinquished. The National Security Law was imposed during protests that have long since ended, but the law remains, and its reach expands.</p>\n\n<p>Second: procedural legitimacy without substantive justice is tyranny in judicial robes. Jimmy Lai had a trial, lawyers, judges, an appeals process. But when the judiciary is selected by the government, the evidence includes protected speech, and the crime is criticism, the trial is theater, not justice.</p>\n\n<p>Third: free speech is not an ancillary right. It is the foundation of self-government. Without it, elections become ratifications, courts become instruments of state power, and citizenship becomes subjecthood.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth: international pressure without consequences is merely noise. Jimmy Lai is a British citizen. The UK government calls his prosecution politically motivated. But he remains in a Hong Kong prison, and British policy toward China continues largely unchanged.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question Before Us</p>\n\n<p>Can we look at what is happening in Hong Kong and say this is compatible with a free society?</p>\n\n<p>Can we accept that a newspaper publisher receives 20 years in prison for articles critical of government policy and still call that place free?</p>\n\n<p>Can we watch the systematic dismantling of press freedom, judicial independence, and political speech and not recognize it as the death of liberty?</p>\n\n<p>The answer matters. Because what happens in Hong Kong does not stay in Hong Kong. It provides a template for authoritarian governments everywhere: impose the law, follow procedure, cite security, and silence dissent with the appearance of legality.</p>\n\n<p>Jimmy Lai will likely die in prison for publishing a newspaper. His journalists are scattered or imprisoned. His newspaper is closed. And Hong Kong's government calls this justice.</p>\n\n<p>It is not justice. It is power, exercised without accountability, legitimized by procedure, enforced by courts that answer to the state rather than the law.</p>\n\n<p>In a free society, you can criticize the government without going to prison.</p>\n\n<p>In Hong Kong, you cannot.</p>\n\n<p>That is the only test that matters.</p>",

The bipartisan consensus reflects a basic economic reality: this crossing handles $130 billion in trade annually, supporting jobs in a swing state that Trump carried twice.</p>\n\n<p>The president now threatens to block it.</p>\n\n<p>Under what authority?</p>\n\n<p>The president cannot unilaterally abrogate an international agreement negotiated in good faith, funded entirely by a foreign partner, and supported by the affected state government. He cannot block infrastructure projects without statutory authorization. He cannot seize assets built and owned by a foreign sovereign without triggering treaty violations and potential retaliation under international law.</p>\n\n<p>He can, however, make the threat.</p>\n\n<p>And the threat itself, unanswered by legal process, uncontested by Congress, unrebutted by federal courts, becomes a form of authority. Not legitimate authority. Not constitutional authority. But authority nonetheless, because no one stops it.</p>\n\n<p>### The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time Trump has threatened to block or seize infrastructure based on grievance rather than law. It will not be the last. What matters is not whether he can legally execute the threat. What matters is whether the threat itself becomes sufficient to extract concessions, to bend behavior, to make other nations and other governors wonder whether compliance is safer than resistance.</p>\n\n<p>That is how law dies.</p>\n\n<p>Not in a single blow, but in a thousand small retreats. Not when power breaks the law openly, but when power makes law irrelevant by making threats more consequential than statutes. When the question shifts from \"What does the law allow?\" to \"What will the president do?\"</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned of this in Federalist No. 47: \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"</p>\n\n<p>The president is not asking Congress to pass legislation giving him authority over this bridge. He is not asking courts to rule on treaty interpretations. He is declaring intent and daring anyone to stop him. That is the accumulation of powers Madison described. That is what tyranny looks like in its procedural form, before it becomes fully realized.</p>\n\n<p>### The Silence That Enables</p>\n\n<p>Congress has not responded.</p>\n\n<p>Federal courts have not been asked to intervene because no formal legal action has been taken, only a threat.</p>\n\n<p>Michigan's governor says the bridge will open \"one way or another,\" but she cannot enforce that against federal obstruction if the president decides to deploy customs agents, if he orders the Coast Guard to deny navigation clearances, if he instructs federal agencies to withhold approvals.</p>\n\n<p>The mechanisms exist. They were created for legitimate purposes under statutory frameworks. They can be repurposed. They can be weaponized. And once weaponized, the law becomes not a limit on power but an instrument of power.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Trump's temperament. This is about the constitutional architecture designed to prevent any president from wielding unchecked power. That architecture only functions when institutions defend their prerogatives. When Congress allows the executive to act without statutory authority, it surrenders its legislative power. When courts decline to hear challenges because threats have not yet materialized into actions, they surrender their judicial power. When governors comply with illegal demands rather than risk confrontation, they surrender federalism itself.</p>\n\n<p>Every surrender makes the next one easier.</p>\n\n<p>### What This Means for a Free Society</p>\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin, leaving the Constitutional Convention, was asked what kind of government had been created. He replied: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"</p>\n\n<p>The keeping is not ceremonial. It is active. It requires that when power overreaches, someone stops it. Not with rhetoric, not with expressions of concern, but with the formal legal mechanisms the Constitution provides.</p>\n\n<p>Can the president block a bridge built by a foreign nation under an international agreement? Not without violating treaties. Not without exceeding statutory authority. Not without Congress and courts permitting it.</p>\n\n<p>But if Congress does not act, if courts do not rule, if the governor cannot enforce her state's interest, then the answer becomes yes. Not because the Constitution allows it, but because no one prevents it.</p>\n\n<p>That is how republics end. Not in revolution, but in acquiescence.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Trump will follow through on this threat. The question is whether the institutions designed to constrain executive overreach still function. If they do not respond to this threat, they will not respond to the next one. And there will be a next one.</p>\n\n<p>This is the test.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have worked in government. I have testified before Congress. I have sat on the other side of that witness table, where the cameras are pointed at you and every word becomes part of the permanent record.</p>\n\n<p>There is a moment in every confirmation hearing when the nominee raises their right hand and swears to tell the truth. That oath is not ceremonial. It carries the force of 18 U.S.C. § 1621, the federal perjury statute. It means that lying to Congress is a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison.</p>\n\n<p>Howard Lutnick, now serving as Secretary of Commerce, told Congress during his confirmation process that he had cut ties with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005. This week, confronted with emails from the Department of Justice showing he visited Epstein's private island in December 2012, four years after Epstein's conviction for soliciting prostitution from a child, Lutnick acknowledged the visit.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't recall why we did it, but we did it,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>The White House response was immediate: Lutnick has the full support of the President.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, already documented and prosecuted. This is about whether truth matters when seeking positions of public trust.</p>\n\n<p>## The Standard We Are Abandoning</p>\n\n<p>Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland identified the constitutional question precisely: \"The issue is not that you engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with Jeffrey Epstein, but that you totally misrepresented the extent of your relationship with him, to the Congress, to the American people and to the survivors of his despicable criminal and predatory acts.\"</p>\n\n<p>That distinction matters.</p>\n\n<p>The confirmation process exists because Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution requires the Senate's advice and consent for principal officers of the United States. The Framers did not trust any single person, even an elected president, to stock the executive branch without oversight. They designed a system where the people's representatives could examine nominees, assess their character, and reject those deemed unfit.</p>\n\n<p>That system only works if nominees tell the truth.</p>\n\n<p>When I prepared witnesses for congressional testimony, the instruction was always the same: tell the truth, completely and without evasion. If you don't remember something, say so. If you made a mistake, admit it. If the truth is embarrassing, that's not a reason to lie. It's a reason to reconsider whether you should be seeking confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>The standard was not \"tell the truth unless it's politically inconvenient.\" The standard was truth, period.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that standard collapse in real time.</p>\n\n<p>## What Gets Normalized</p>\n\n<p>Lutnick visited Epstein's island with his wife, four children, and nannies on December 23, 2012. The emails show his wife wrote to Epstein's assistant: \"We are looking forward to visiting you\" and \"We would love to join you for lunch.\" This was not an accidental encounter. This was a planned family visit to a convicted sex offender's private retreat.</p>\n\n<p>Lutnick now says he met Epstein only twice in fourteen years after 2005, that he \"barely had anything to do with that person,\" that within millions of pages of documents only ten emails connect them.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps. But that is not what he told Congress when seeking confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>When confronted with contradictory evidence, the response was not \"I misled you and I apologize.\" It was \"I don't recall why we did it, but we did it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Memory is selective. People forget details, conflate events, misremember timelines. That is human. What is not human error is the systematic construction of a narrative designed to pass Senate scrutiny, followed by selective amnesia when documentary evidence emerges.</p>\n\n<p>This is how standards erode. Not through dramatic confrontations, but through small accommodations, repeated until they become normal.</p>\n\n<p>## The Bipartisan Question</p>\n\n<p>Representatives Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, both called for Lutnick's resignation. They co-sponsored the legislation that mandated release of the Epstein documents. They have seen the unredacted files. Their judgment, formed independently across partisan lines, was clear.</p>\n\n<p>That bipartisan consensus is worth noting.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a question of policy preference or political loyalty. This is a question of whether someone who misrepresented material facts during Senate testimony should continue to hold a position requiring Senate confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 51 that \"the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Senate's power to reject nominees is one of those constitutional means. But it only functions if there are consequences for misrepresenting facts during the confirmation process. If there are no consequences, the check disappears. The power to advise and consent becomes merely the power to schedule hearings.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Howard Lutnick committed any crime related to Jeffrey Epstein. No evidence suggests he did.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether visiting someone later convicted of crimes makes you complicit in those crimes. Association is not guilt.</p>\n\n<p>The question is this: Should someone who provided materially misleading testimony during Senate confirmation hearings continue to serve in a position requiring Senate confirmation?</p>\n\n<p>That question has an obvious answer under any constitutional framework that takes separation of powers seriously. The Senate confirmed Lutnick based on representations he now acknowledges were incomplete. Documentary evidence contradicts his sworn testimony. Members of Congress from both parties have called for his resignation.</p>\n\n<p>The President says Lutnick has his full support.</p>\n\n<p>What is being established here is that presidential loyalty supersedes truthfulness to Congress. That is not a conservative or liberal position. That is a structural claim about where power resides.</p>\n\n<p>If nominees know that misrepresenting facts during confirmation carries no consequence, so long as they retain presidential favor, then the Senate's constitutional role becomes ceremonial. The advice and consent power becomes advice, perhaps, but consent without meaningful choice.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Is Here</p>\n\n<p>I have watched norms erode before. I have seen how institutional practices that seemed permanent turned out to be merely customary. I have learned that \"that's how we've always done it\" is not the same as \"that's what the law requires.\"</p>\n\n<p>What protects constitutional structure is not tradition. What protects it is people in positions of authority saying \"this far and no further.\"</p>\n\n<p>Two members of Congress, from opposite parties, have drawn that line. They have said that misrepresenting material facts during Senate testimony should disqualify someone from confirmed office.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether anyone else will join them.</p>\n\n<p>Not whether they agree with Lutnick's tariff policy. Not whether they like his other qualifications. Not whether they think he's doing a good job as Commerce Secretary.</p>\n\n<p>Whether truth to Congress still matters.</p>\n\n<p>If it doesn't, we should be clear about what we're becoming. We're becoming a system where presidential appointees answer only to the President, where Senate oversight exists only to ratify decisions already made, where oath-taking becomes a photo opportunity rather than a legal commitment.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a constitutional republic. That's a different thing.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years working in international trade negotiations. The contracts were thick, the language precise, the implications massive. What I learned is this: sovereignty isn't lost in dramatic invasions or sudden coups. It's surrendered in arbitration clauses, in regulatory exemptions, in court rulings that quietly remove a nation's authority to oversee its own territory.</p>\n\n<p>That's what happened in Peru last month.</p>\n\n<p>A lower court judge issued a ruling barring Peru's transport regulator, Ositran, from exercising \"powers of regulation, supervision, oversight and sanction\" over the Chinese-built port at Chancay. The port covers 445 acres of Peruvian soil. It's owned by China's state-controlled Cosco Shipping. And now, according to this ruling, Peru's government cannot regulate it the way it regulates every other port in the country.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration called this a loss of sovereignty. China's Foreign Ministry called it rumor-mongering. Cosco insisted the port remains \"under the jurisdiction, sovereignty and control of Peruvian authorities.\"</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't who's telling the truth in their press statements.</p>\n\n<p>The question is what \"sovereignty\" means when a foreign entity operates critical infrastructure on your territory and your own courts say you can't oversee it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Dependency</p>\n\n<p>China's Belt and Road Initiative has financed ports, highways, airports, and power plants across six continents. The loans are substantial, $1.3 billion for Chancay alone. The terms are often opaque. The legal structures are complex. And the pattern is consistent: infrastructure projects that become points of permanent leverage.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't colonialism in the 19th-century sense. There are no viceroys, no military occupations, no formal annexations.</p>\n\n<p>But examine the court ruling. Ositran, Peru's transport regulator, oversees safety standards, user protections, and operational compliance at every major port in the country. It ensures that ports serving the public meet national standards. The agency was created precisely to prevent monopolistic abuse and ensure accountability to Peruvian citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Now a Peruvian court has ruled that this authority doesn't extend to Chancay.</p>\n\n<p>Cosco Shipping, the ruling states, cannot be supervised the way every other company providing public services in Peru is supervised.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what that means in practice. If there's an environmental violation, can Peru act? If labor standards are ignored, can Peru enforce them? If pricing becomes predatory, can Peru intervene? The court's language suggests no: regulation, supervision, oversight, and sanction are all barred.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a commercial contract. That's a carve-out from national law.</p>\n\n<p>## The Mechanism of Erosion</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned in Federalist 47 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"</p>\n\n<p>He was writing about the separation of powers within government. But the principle extends to the relationship between nations. When a foreign entity operates on your soil and your own legal system cannot hold it accountable, power has accumulated in hands beyond your democratic control.</p>\n\n<p>The architecture here is deliberate. The Belt and Road contracts often include dispute resolution clauses that bypass local courts entirely, sending conflicts to international arbitration panels. The financing structures create debt dependencies that constrain policy choices. The operational agreements, like the one at Chancay, establish zones where normal regulatory authority doesn't reach.</p>\n\n<p>Each element alone seems reasonable. International arbitration for cross-border disputes makes sense. Financing terms reflect risk assessments. Operational efficiency requires some autonomy. But together, they create a system where a nation's formal sovereignty remains intact while its practical authority steadily drains away.</p>\n\n<p>Peru still has a flag over Chancay. It still collects some taxes. Police and customs officials still work there. But the most important question, can Peru govern what happens on 445 acres of its own territory, now has an ambiguous answer.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals About Power</p>\n\n<p>The concern isn't that China is uniquely predatory. The United States has its own history of using economic leverage to constrain other nations' choices. The concern is the mechanism itself, how infrastructure investment becomes a vector for permanent influence, how commercial agreements supersede democratic accountability, how sovereignty transforms from a meaningful capacity to govern into a legal fiction maintained for diplomatic appearances.</p>\n\n<p>Verónica Zambrano, president of Ositran, made the key point to local radio: Cosco Shipping \"would be the only company providing services to the public that could not be supervised.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not \"difficult to supervise.\" Not \"supervised under different rules.\"</p>\n\n<p>Cannot be supervised.</p>\n\n<p>That's the constitutional principle at stake. A government that cannot regulate activity on its own soil, that cannot enforce its own laws on entities operating within its borders, that cannot protect its own citizens from abuse by those entities, has lost something fundamental to self-governance.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether Peru made a bad deal. Nations make development choices under constrained circumstances all the time. The question is whether those choices can be revisited, whether democratic processes can respond to problems as they emerge, whether accountability remains possible when things go wrong.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, if the court ruling stands, if regulatory oversight has been permanently waived, then Peru has traded current economic benefit for future political constraint. That's not sovereignty. That's a service agreement where one party can't change the terms.</p>\n\n<p>## The Larger Pattern</p>\n\n<p>This matters beyond Peru. China is now the largest trading partner for most of Latin America. Belt and Road projects span the continent. Similar port facilities, similar financing arrangements, similar legal structures are being replicated from Ecuador to Argentina to Brazil.</p>\n\n<p>Each negotiation is bilateral. Each contract is specific. But the pattern is consistent: critical infrastructure built with Chinese capital, operated by Chinese firms, insulated from local oversight through legal mechanisms that sound technical but have profound political implications.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration's warning, that \"cheap Chinese money costs sovereignty,\" is correct in principle even if its motivation is strategic competition rather than concern for democratic governance. The price of infrastructure isn't just the loan repayment. It's the authority you surrender over what happens next.</p>\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin's response when asked what form of government the Constitutional Convention had created, \"A republic, if you can keep it,\" assumed that the threat to republican government would be internal corruption or external conquest. He likely didn't anticipate a world where sovereignty would be negotiated away in commercial contracts, upheld by domestic courts applying terms that foreign investors demanded as conditions of their capital.</p>\n\n<p>But that's the world we inhabit now.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question That Matters</p>\n\n<p>Peru's government says it will appeal the ruling. Ositran argues there's no legitimate reason to exempt Cosco from the oversight that applies to everyone else. That's the right fight to have. Whether they win it depends on how Peruvian courts interpret their own authority and whether they're willing to subordinate commercial agreements to constitutional principle.</p>\n\n<p>But the larger question facing democracies globally is this: Can you remain self-governing when critical systems are controlled by entities beyond your legal reach?</p>\n\n<p>Not \"Is foreign investment good or bad?\" Not \"Should we do business with China?\" Those are policy questions with complex answers that vary by context.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is simpler and more fundamental: Does your legal system still run where foreign capital operates?</p>\n\n<p>If it doesn't, if regulatory authority stops at the border of foreign-owned facilities on your own soil, then you've created internal zones where democratic accountability doesn't reach. You've accepted that some activities within your territory exist beyond your law. You've redefined sovereignty from \"the capacity to govern\" to \"the appearance of governing, except where we've agreed not to.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not compatible with self-governance. It's something else, dressed in the language of partnership and development.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't whether Peru gets economic benefit from Chancay. The test is whether Peru retains the capacity to address problems if they emerge, to change course if the arrangement proves harmful, to enforce its own standards on its own territory.</p>\n\n<p>If the court ruling stands, the answer is no.</p>\n\n<p>That's not sovereignty. That's dependency with better branding.</p>\n\n<p>**In Union there is Strength.**</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in government service watching how institutions make decisions that bind the nation. You learn quickly that the hardest questions are not about policy preferences. They are about process, about legitimacy, about who gets to decide what counts as fact.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has revoked the EPA's 2009 endangerment finding, the scientific determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health. They call it \"the largest deregulation in American history.\" That phrase alone should give us pause.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about whether you believe climate science or trust market solutions over regulation. This is about something more fundamental: whether an administration can simply declare scientific findings invalid because they constrain its policy goals.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question No One Is Asking</p>\n\n<p>The debate has immediately divided along predictable lines. One side talks about regulatory costs and manufacturing competitiveness. The other side warns of premature deaths and asthma attacks. Both arguments matter. Neither addresses the constitutional question at the heart of this action.</p>\n\n<p>Can the executive branch revoke a scientific finding by fiat?</p>\n\n<p>The 2009 endangerment finding was not a regulation. It was a determination of fact, made by the EPA after reviewing thousands of studies and receiving over 380,000 public comments. It responded to a 2007 Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled that greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and that the EPA must determine whether they endanger public health.</p>\n\n<p>The EPA concluded they do.</p>\n\n<p>Now an administration has decided they don't. Not because new science emerged. Not because the methodology was flawed. Because the finding became \"the legal foundation\" for regulations this administration opposes.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a scientific reassessment. That's a political reversal dressed in scientific language.</p>\n\n<p>## How Facts Become Negotiable</p>\n\n<p>I've watched this pattern before, in different contexts. When institutional findings constrain political objectives, the solution is to discredit the institution or reframe the finding as opinion rather than fact.</p>\n\n<p>The administration formed what they called a scientific panel. A federal judge ruled that panel's formation violated the law. The panel's report, which challenged \"widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases,\" was criticized by climate experts as \"unrepresentative,\" \"inaccurate,\" and \"misleading.\"</p>\n\n<p>Yet that report became the basis for revoking the endangerment finding.</p>\n\n<p>This is how facts become negotiable. You don't argue the science directly. You create an alternative process that produces the conclusion you need, then cite that process as justification. When courts reject the process, you've already moved forward with the policy.</p>\n\n<p>The determination of what endangers public health is no longer treated as a question of evidence. It's treated as a question of authority. Whoever holds executive power decides what the facts are.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>Here is what makes this action different from normal regulatory back-and-forth.</p>\n\n<p>Administrations routinely change regulations. That's expected. New presidents bring different policy priorities. But those changes typically work within established factual frameworks. You might disagree about how to respond to a threat, but you don't simply declare the threat doesn't exist because addressing it is inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>The endangerment finding was precisely that kind of factual framework. It said: these gases endanger public health. How to address that endangerment was always open to debate. Market mechanisms, technological innovation, state-level action, federal standards—all legitimate areas of policy disagreement.</p>\n\n<p>Revoking the finding changes the nature of the question. It says: there is no threat to address.</p>\n\n<p>The implications extend far beyond climate policy.</p>\n\n<p>If an administration can revoke a scientific determination because it constrains policy options, what other factual findings become negotiable? Can an EPA determination about water contamination be revoked if cleanup costs are deemed too high? Can a surgeon general's finding about tobacco be rescinded if it burdens an industry? Can a Pentagon assessment of military readiness be dismissed if it requires uncomfortable budget choices?</p>\n\n<p>The principle being established is that scientific determinations are merely recommendations, subject to political override.</p>\n\n<p>## The Supreme Court Strategy</p>\n\n<p>Legal experts quoted in the reporting suggest the administration wants this tested before the Supreme Court during Trump's term. The goal, apparently, is to secure a ruling that would make the reversal permanent, beyond the reach of future administrations \"in the absence of new legislation.\"</p>\n\n<p>Think carefully about what that means.</p>\n\n<p>An executive action, ratified by a Court decision, would prevent future executives from reinstating a scientific finding without Congressional action. In a system where Congress struggles to pass basic legislation, that creates a one-way ratchet. Easy to tear down, nearly impossible to rebuild.</p>\n\n<p>This is how temporary authorities become permanent. Not through dramatic power grabs, but through strategic use of divided government and judicial ratification.</p>\n\n<p>The irony is that the endangerment finding itself was used to block state climate lawsuits, on the grounds that federal authority had primacy. Now that federal authority is being eliminated, states may be free to pursue litigation the finding previously prevented. The administration may have opened the door to exactly the kind of fragmented, case-by-case climate liability they claim to oppose.</p>\n\n<p>Unintended consequences flow from treating science as policy.</p>\n\n<p>## What We're Really Deciding</p>\n\n<p>Strip away the climate debate. Set aside the economic arguments. Focus on the institutional question.</p>\n\n<p>We are deciding whether scientific determinations by federal agencies can be treated as binding findings of fact, or whether they are merely advisory opinions subject to political revision whenever they become inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>We are deciding whether \"endangers public health\" is a question answered by evidence and expertise, or a question answered by whoever holds executive power.</p>\n\n<p>We are deciding whether facts have weight in governance, or whether they are just another input to be accepted or rejected based on policy preferences.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned in Federalist 10 about the dangers of factions that place their immediate interests above the permanent and aggregate interests of the community. He believed institutional structures could check those impulses. But those structures only work if facts remain facts, if scientific determinations cannot be wished away because they constrain political action.</p>\n\n<p>When science becomes negotiable, power becomes untethered from reality.</p>\n\n<p>## A Question for Citizens</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing that the endangerment finding should be beyond scrutiny. Scientific consensus can shift. Methods can be questioned. Evidence can be reweighed.</p>\n\n<p>But that process requires actual science, not a hand-picked panel whose formation violated the law. It requires engaging with evidence, not dismissing it because regulations that flow from it are costly.</p>\n\n<p>The question citizens must ask is this: Do we want to live in a system where facts are determined by evidence, or by authority?</p>\n\n<p>Because once you establish that facts are whatever the executive declares them to be, you have surrendered the most basic protection against arbitrary power.</p>\n\n<p>You can change policies. You can change regulations. You can change approaches.</p>\n\n<p>But you cannot change facts by decree and still call yourself a government of laws.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction matters.

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to recognize when institutions speak words they do not mean. Venezuela's interim leaders promise amnesty while hundreds remain imprisoned. They speak of reconciliation while the courts that jailed dissidents remain unchanged. They offer peace while destroying the evidence of torture.</p>\n\n<p>This is not amnesty. This is erasure.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what is actually happening in Caracas. After a U.S. military operation removed Nicolás Maduro from power, his former vice president now leads an \"interim\" government. She has freed 431 political prisoners since January. She pledges to close El Helicoide, a prison notorious for torture. She promotes an amnesty law that the National Assembly, still controlled by Maduro's Socialist Party, will surely pass.</p>\n\n<p>Yet 500 dissidents remain jailed. Thousands more face pending charges. And the very judges who imprisoned them for criticizing the regime, the very security forces who tortured them, remain in place. The courts have not changed. The prosecutors have not changed. The apparatus of repression has not changed.</p>\n\n<p>Only the rhetoric has changed.</p>\n\n<p>The amnesty bill reveals its purpose in its details. It calls for destroying prisoners' files. For a government seeking justice, this makes no sense. For a government seeking to eliminate evidence of systematic torture and abuse, it makes perfect sense. The Venezuelan legal aid group Foro Penal warns that this \"could lead to the elimination of evidence that could be key in the eventual prosecution of human rights violations.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not a bug. That is the feature.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the mechanism of normalization: A regime falls, but its institutions endure. New leaders speak of reconciliation while preserving the structures of repression. They offer amnesty not as restoration of rights, but as mutual absolution. The message to victims is clear: Accept this deal. Forget what happened. Move on.</p>\n\n<p>Or face the same judges who imprisoned you before.</p>\n\n<p>The draft law portrays government officials and opposition activists as equally responsible for violence. \"Dissidents are demanding amnesty,\" says ruling party legislator Iris Varela, \"but they lack the humility to recognize that the state is prepared to pardon them for all the crimes they committed.\" This is the language of false equivalence. It treats unarmed dissidents who criticized the government the same as security forces who tortured them. It places speaking truth to power on the same moral plane as wielding power to crush truth.</p>\n\n<p>This matters beyond Venezuela because it demonstrates how accountability disappears. Not through dramatic refusal, but through bureaucratic accommodation. Not by defending the old regime, but by quietly preserving its machinery while speaking of change.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is ancient. When the Athenian democracy restored itself after the rule of the Thirty Tyrants in 403 BC, it declared amnesty. But amnesty came after purging the oligarchic courts, after exile of the worst offenders, after explicit acknowledgment of crimes committed. The Athenians understood that you cannot have genuine reconciliation without first establishing what requires reconciliation. You cannot forgive what you refuse to name.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela's \"amnesty\" inverts this principle. It seeks to erase the record before justice can examine it. It asks victims to go before their persecutors and request pardon for having been persecuted. It speaks of peace while maintaining the apparatus that created the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Political analyst Nicmer Evans understands this. Recently freed after imprisonment for criticizing Maduro, he still faces charges of terrorism and hate crimes. He cannot leave Venezuela. He must report to authorities every 15 days. These are not the conditions of amnesty. These are the conditions of a suspended sentence, subject to renewal at the state's discretion.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm not allowed to leave the country,\" he told NPR. Yet he also said, \"We are better off than we were in December. In December, I was in jail. Today, I'm not.\" This is the calculus of the powerless: measuring freedom by degrees of captivity, measuring justice by the distance from the worst abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Interim President Delcy Rodríguez promises that \"revenge, retaliation, and hatred must not overwhelm us.\" This sounds like reconciliation. But reconciliation requires two elements she has not mentioned: truth and accountability. Without investigating what happened, without holding perpetrators responsible, without reforming the institutions that enabled abuse, you do not achieve reconciliation. You achieve silence.</p>\n\n<p>Human Rights Watch's Americas director Juanita Goebertus identifies the core problem: \"There has to be acknowledgment that there were very serious human rights violations committed by the regime. And there has to be truth-telling about these crimes. And that is certainly not present in this amnesty bill at all.\"</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether some prisoners have been freed. The question is whether the system that imprisoned them has been dismantled.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether amnesty legislation will pass. The question is whether it creates accountability or destroys evidence.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Maduro's vice president now speaks differently than Maduro did. The question is whether she governs differently.</p>\n\n<p>These distinctions matter because they mark the difference between genuine transition and managed continuity. They determine whether what happened in Venezuela represents a change in regime or merely a change in personnel. They establish whether amnesty serves victims or protects perpetrators.</p>\n\n<p>In 1787, James Madison warned in Federalist No. 47 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" Venezuela's amnesty bill demonstrates what happens when tyranny does not end, but simply changes its rhetoric: The same courts remain. The same prosecutors remain. The same security forces remain. Only the promises change.</p>\n\n<p>This is how accountability dies. Not with a fight, but with a deal. Not by defending the old regime, but by quietly preserving its capacity to silence dissent while speaking the language of reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>That capacity, unchecked, will be used again.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to understand something most people never see: how a state kills someone matters almost as much as whether they do it.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Alexei Navalny's politics. This is not about whether you supported his movement or opposed it. This is about what five European nations—the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands—felt compelled to do on February 14, 2026: formally accuse the Russian Federation of murdering a political opponent with a chemical weapon derived from the skin of South American poison dart frogs.</p>\n\n<p>Let that specificity sit with you.</p>\n\n<p>They named the toxin. Epibatidine. They detailed its effects: shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate, death. They noted it does not occur naturally in Russia. They stated Russia had \"the means, motive and opportunity.\" They invoked the Chemical Weapons Convention. They referred the matter to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</p>\n\n<p>This level of precision is not rhetorical. It is evidentiary. It is the language governments use when they are creating a record for history.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern Russia Established</p>\n\n<p>Navalny's death is the fourth high-profile assassination or attempted assassination the Russian government has been credibly accused of conducting with chemical or radiological weapons:</p>\n\n<p>- Alexander Litvinenko, 2006: Polonium-210 in London\n- Sergei Skripal, 2018: Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury\n- Navalny himself, 2020: Novichok nerve agent, survived\n- Navalny, 2024: Epibatidine in an Arctic prison colony</p>\n\n<p>Each time, British inquiries concluded the attacks were \"probably approved\" or \"must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin.\" Each time, Russia denied involvement. Each time, the evidence accumulated. Each time, the international response was measured, diplomatic, procedural.</p>\n\n<p>And each time, the threshold for what is tolerated moved.</p>\n\n<p>## What Makes This Different</p>\n\n<p>Five nations do not jointly accuse another state of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention lightly. The Convention, signed by 193 countries, prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. It is one of the foundational agreements of post-World War II international order—the kind of treaty that exists because the world once saw what happens when states use these weapons and decided, collectively, never again.</p>\n\n<p>Russia is a signatory. Russia is also a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Russia violated the treaty. The evidence suggests it did. The question is what it means when a permanent Security Council member, entrusted with maintaining international peace, systematically violates prohibitions on chemical weapons to eliminate domestic critics.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a border dispute. This is not about spheres of influence or contested territory. This is about whether the rules that constrain state power apply to the powerful.</p>\n\n<p>## The American Precedent We Ignore</p>\n\n<p>Americans watching this should feel an uncomfortable recognition.</p>\n\n<p>We, too, have normalized what once would have been extraordinary. Indefinite detention without trial at Guantanamo Bay, authorized as a temporary measure after September 11, 2001, continues twenty-five years later. Surveillance authorities granted as emergency powers have become permanent infrastructure. Drone strikes conducted without judicial review are now routine. Each was justified as necessary. Each was promised to be temporary. Each quietly became normal.</p>\n\n<p>The test of whether you live in a free society is not what your government does in crisis. It is what remains prohibited when the crisis ends.</p>\n\n<p>Russia's use of chemical weapons against political opponents is not a distant authoritarian horror we can observe with detachment. It is a warning about what happens when temporary powers become permanent, when extraordinary measures become ordinary, when the law shifts from protecting liberty to merely justifying process.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>The five European nations did something important: they said it out loud.</p>\n\n<p>They created a formal record. They invoked treaty obligations. They named what happened. This matters not because it will immediately change Russian behavior, but because it establishes what the standard is. When future historians ask whether the West understood what was happening, the answer will be: yes, they understood, and they said so.</p>\n\n<p>Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny's widow, was at the Munich Security Conference when the announcement came. She had spent two years insisting her husband was murdered, had been met with diplomatic equivocation, had watched as governments that privately agreed with her publicly hedged. Now five of them said it plainly.</p>\n\n<p>\"Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon,\" she wrote. \"Putin is a murderer who must be held accountable.\"</p>\n\n<p>That clarity is what accountability begins with: naming what happened.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question Citizens Must Ask</p>\n\n<p>Whether Russia will face meaningful consequences for violating the Chemical Weapons Convention is a separate question from whether the violation occurred. The evidence suggests it did. What matters now is whether the international community enforces the rules or admits they do not apply to the powerful.</p>\n\n<p>This is where American citizens should pay attention.</p>\n\n<p>When we accept that some states are above the law, we are not simply tolerating injustice elsewhere. We are establishing the principle that power, sufficiently concentrated, need not answer to law. That principle does not stop at borders. It does not distinguish between foreign policy and domestic governance. It spreads.</p>\n\n<p>The same logic that says Russia can use chemical weapons against political opponents without consequence is the logic that says any sufficiently powerful actor can do what is expedient rather than what is lawful.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether we can stop Russia. The question is whether we still believe in the principle that anyone can be stopped.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Moment Demands</p>\n\n<p>Five European nations, two years after Navalny's death, presented evidence that Russia murdered a political prisoner with a toxin that causes convulsions and suffocation. They did so formally, through diplomatic channels, invoking international law.</p>\n\n<p>This is what bearing witness looks like.</p>\n\n<p>It does not guarantee justice. It does not immediately constrain power. But it establishes the record. It says, for history and for citizens still capable of hearing it: this happened, we saw it, we named it, and it violated the rules we agreed would govern us.</p>\n\n<p>That act of naming is not sufficient. But it is necessary. Without it, everything that follows is already lost.</p>\n\n<p>The test is whether enough people still believe the rules should matter, even when enforcing them is difficult, even when the violator is powerful, even when doing so is inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The headline reads like an academic exercise: a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian assessing presidential power. But the framing reveals something more significant than the content it claims to summarize.</p>\n\n<p>We've reached the moment when respectable outlets feel compelled to ask scholars whether what's happening is compatible with constitutional government.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a book review. That's a diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>I've sat in classified briefings where the question wasn't whether authority existed, but how far it extended. I've watched legal memoranda transform from caution into permission. I've seen the language shift from \"may we\" to \"we will\" to \"we have always done this.\"</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is familiar. Authority expands during crisis. Crisis becomes permanent. Expansion becomes precedent.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this moment distinct is not that presidential power is growing. Power always seeks to grow. What's distinct is the collapse of the institutional resistance that historically constrained that growth.</p>\n\n<p>When historians are called to assess whether democratic norms are holding, it means the institutions designed to answer that question, Congress, courts, civil society, have already failed to provide clarity.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Trump. This is about what happens when the constitutional architecture designed to contain any president begins to crack under sustained pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the mechanics. Article II vests executive power in the President. But the Founders, familiar with unchecked monarchy, surrounded that power with constraints: legislative appropriations, Senate confirmation, judicial review, the ultimate check of impeachment.</p>\n\n<p>Those constraints depend not on parchment but on people willing to enforce them.</p>\n\n<p>When Congress declines to assert its appropriations power because doing so might be politically costly, the constraint weakens. When courts defer to executive claims of necessity without demanding evidence, the constraint bends. When confirmation processes become partisan battlegrounds rather than competency reviews, the constraint fails.</p>\n\n<p>Each failure creates precedent. Not legal precedent, in most cases, but something more dangerous: political precedent. The precedent that says: this can be done, has been done, will be done again.</p>\n\n<p>I remember a conversation with a senior official during the early War on Terror. He was explaining why certain enhanced interrogation techniques, his term, were necessary. When I pressed on Geneva Convention obligations, he said something I've never forgotten: \"The law is what the lawyers say it is when no one stops you.\"</p>\n\n<p>He was wrong about the law. But he was right about power.</p>\n\n<p>Presidential power expands not primarily through constitutional interpretation, though that matters. It expands through the accumulation of actions taken that face no effective resistance. Each action not challenged becomes the new baseline. Each baseline becomes the foundation for the next expansion.</p>\n\n<p>This is how temporary authorities become permanent. This is how emergency powers become ordinary governance. This is how republics drift toward something else.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't whether the President cites legal authority. Presidents always cite legal authority. The test is whether the other branches, and ultimately the people, accept that authority as legitimate.</p>\n\n<p>When acceptance comes not from deliberation but from exhaustion, when opposition fails not because the arguments are won but because the will to resist has eroded, that's when the architecture starts to fail.</p>\n\n<p>Jon Meacham's book, as described, is a collection of original texts spanning American history. The implicit argument of such a collection is that we've faced constitutional crises before and survived. The founders anticipated conflict. Lincoln preserved the Union. FDR balanced emergency power with democratic accountability.</p>\n\n<p>All true. But survival isn't guaranteed by precedent. It's achieved by each generation choosing to enforce constraints, even when enforcement is difficult, even when the politics are complicated, even when the crisis feels urgent.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether historians can identify parallels. The question is whether we still have the institutional courage to act on them.</p>\n\n<p>What concerns me most isn't any single expansion of presidential authority. What concerns me is the pattern of expansion meeting reduced resistance, creating new baselines, which enable further expansion, in an accelerating cycle.</p>\n\n<p>This is how constitutional government fails. Not through coup or revolution, but through the slow accumulation of precedents that, individually, seem defensible, but collectively, transform the system.</p>\n\n<p>I'm reminded of Madison in Federalist 51: \"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\" The entire structure of the Constitution assumes that each branch will defend its own institutional prerogatives against encroachment by the others.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when ambition stops counteracting?</p>\n\n<p>What happens when Congress is more concerned with partisan advantage than institutional authority? When courts defer to executive claims without demanding proof? When the public is too exhausted to distinguish between normal governance and constitutional crisis?</p>\n\n<p>What happens is what we're witnessing: power flows to the institution most willing to assert it.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't partisan. Democratic presidents have expanded executive authority. Republican presidents have expanded it further. Each expansion is justified by the previous one. Each becomes the foundation for the next.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is bipartisan. The danger is constitutional.</p>\n\n<p>When NPR interviews a historian about whether presidential power has grown too large, it's not conducting an academic seminar. It's asking whether the republic is holding.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the question is being asked suggests those asking already know the answer.</p>\n\n<p>The test of a constitutional system isn't whether power seeks to expand. Power always seeks to expand. The test is whether the system contains mechanisms to resist that expansion, and whether the people operating the system have the will to use them.</p>\n\n<p>We're failing that test. Not because the mechanisms don't exist. They do. We're failing because we've stopped using them.</p>\n\n<p>Every authority not challenged becomes accepted. Every expansion not resisted becomes precedent. Every precedent becomes the new baseline.</p>\n\n<p>This is how you lose a republic. Not dramatically, but incrementally. Not through the abandonment of law, but through its reinterpretation. Not through the destruction of institutions, but through their capture and repurposing.</p>\n\n<p>The question historians will ask about this period isn't whether we had the constitutional tools to resist. We do. The question will be whether we had the civic courage to use them.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why we're asking historians what they think.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in uniform. You learn early that authority matters less than legitimacy, and legitimacy comes from clarity about your role and your limits.</p>\n\n<p>A police officer wears a badge that represents local accountability. You answer to the community you serve, the department that trained you, the laws of your state. When something goes wrong, citizens know where to go. The chain of responsibility runs to people they can vote out or sue or confront at a town hall.</p>\n\n<p>That clarity is dissolving.</p>\n\n<p>Between January and February 2025, more than 1,100 local law enforcement agencies signed agreements deputizing their officers as federal immigration agents. In 2019, during the first Trump administration, there were 45 such agreements. Now there are 1,412 across 40 states.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about immigration policy. This is about what happens when we obscure the lines between local and federal power without asking what we lose in the process.</p>\n\n<p>**The Mechanics of Deputization**</p>\n\n<p>Section 287(g) of the 1996 immigration law allows local police to act as immigration enforcement officers. After 40 hours of training, a patrol officer can question people about their immigration status, investigate civil immigration violations, and arrest individuals for being in the country unlawfully.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of new agreements follow the \"task force model.\" Officers enforce immigration law \"during their routine police duties throughout their local communities,\" according to DHS. That means traffic stops. Neighborhood patrols. Responses to domestic calls.</p>\n\n<p>A person pulled over for a broken taillight now faces an officer wearing a local uniform who wields federal immigration authority.</p>\n\n<p>The officer answers to both a local chief and an ICE supervisor. The arrest happens under federal authority but in a local interaction. If something goes wrong, accountability splits. The city might be liable. The federal government might claim immunity. The citizen might spend years in court trying to figure out who violated their rights.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned in Federalist 51 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands\" is \"the very definition of tyranny.\" He was thinking vertically, about separation of powers within a government. But the principle applies horizontally too. When local officers assume federal powers without clear accountability, we don't just blur lines. We erase them.</p>\n\n<p>**Incentives and Performance**</p>\n\n<p>The federal government is paying for this. ICE now reimburses participating agencies for the full salary and benefits of each deputized officer, including up to 25% of their annual salary in overtime. Agencies also qualify for quarterly monetary performance awards \"based on the successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE.\"</p>\n\n<p>Read that again. Local police departments receive cash bonuses for finding people to hand over to federal authorities.</p>\n\n<p>This transforms the nature of policing. A local officer's job is to keep the peace, investigate crimes, protect the community. When that officer becomes eligible for federal performance bonuses based on immigration arrests, the incentive structure changes. The question is no longer \"What does this community need?\" The question becomes \"How do I maximize the metric ICE is rewarding?\"</p>\n\n<p>The Government Accountability Office noted in 2009 and again in 2021 that ICE has never established clear performance metrics for the 287(g) program. As of 2025, those metrics still don't exist. Agencies are being paid and rewarded, but no one has defined what success looks like or how to measure civil rights compliance.</p>\n\n<p>We are paying local police to pursue a federal goal we have not clearly defined, using standards we have not established, under an accountability structure we have not clarified.</p>\n\n<p>**The History of Restraint**</p>\n\n<p>The 287(g) program has existed since 1996. For most of its history, administrations used it sparingly or not at all.</p>\n\n<p>Doris Meissner, who led the Immigration and Naturalization Service under President Clinton, recalls that the administration opposed the provision. Immigration enforcement had always been exclusively federal. Local police had their own job. Mixing the two wasn't \"in the playbook.\" No 287(g) agreements were signed during Clinton's presidency.</p>\n\n<p>After September 11, the Bush administration expanded the program, prioritizing jail-based enforcement. By the mid-2000s, dozens of agreements were in place.</p>\n\n<p>The Obama administration used jail enforcement extensively, contributing to historic deportation numbers. But in 2012, after documented civil rights abuses in Maricopa County, Arizona, Obama suspended all task force models, the kind that put deputized officers on the streets. The administration found that street-level enforcement mostly caught people without serious criminal histories, pulled over \"for different reasons.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Biden administration left the program largely intact despite campaign promises to end it.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have 1,412 agreements, most of them signed in a single year, most of them using the street-level task force model that Obama suspended.</p>\n\n<p>The restraint of previous administrations wasn't partisan squeamishness. It was recognition that this kind of power is dangerous when it operates without constraint.</p>\n\n<p>**What Gets Lost**</p>\n\n<p>I've worked in government long enough to know that most people in law enforcement are trying to do the right thing. They're not monsters. They're professionals operating under the authorities they've been given.</p>\n\n<p>That's exactly the problem.</p>\n\n<p>When a local officer becomes a federal agent, something happens to the relationship between police and community. Immigrants, documented and undocumented, stop calling 911 when they witness crimes. Victims of domestic violence don't report abuse if they fear the responding officer might ask about immigration status. Witnesses disappear. Whole neighborhoods go dark.</p>\n\n<p>The officer didn't change. The authority did. And the community's trust collapsed under the weight of that new authority.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't speculation. Litigation over 287(g) agreements has cost local taxpayers millions. U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents have been arrested and held for days under immigration authority. People have been detained in local jails longer than their criminal sentences required while awaiting ICE agents who never came.</p>\n\n<p>DHS insists that civil rights protections are robust, that accusations of racial profiling are \"disgusting and categorically FALSE.\" But the record shows otherwise. The Maricopa County case wasn't ideological fantasy. It was years of documented constitutional violations that cost taxpayers over $100 million in settlements.</p>\n\n<p>When authority is unclear, violations are inevitable. When accountability is split, redress becomes impossible.</p>\n\n<p>**The Constitutional Question**</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether immigration enforcement is legitimate. It is. This isn't about whether the federal government has authority over immigration. It does.</p>\n\n<p>This is about what happens when we delegate federal power to local actors without the structures that make federal power answerable.</p>\n\n<p>Federal officers operate under federal oversight, federal civil rights protections, federal standards of conduct. They can be sued under federal law. Their chain of command runs to officials appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. When they exceed their authority, there are mechanisms, however imperfect, for accountability.</p>\n\n<p>Local officers operating under 287(g) agreements inhabit a gray zone. They wield federal power but remain local employees. They make arrests under ICE supervision but during routine local patrols. When something goes wrong, who is responsible? The local department? ICE? Both? Neither?</p>\n\n<p>The speed of this expansion should trouble anyone who cares about limited government. We went from 45 agreements to more than 1,400 in less than six years. Most of that expansion happened in twelve months.</p>\n\n<p>No major legislation authorized this. No national debate preceded it. An executive order on day one, and suddenly 1,100 local police departments are exercising federal immigration authority.</p>\n\n<p>That's not how power is supposed to work in a constitutional republic.</p>\n\n<p>**The Test**</p>\n\n<p>The hardest thing I learned in service is that good intentions don't prevent abuse. Systems do. Structures do. Clear lines of authority and accountability do.</p>\n\n<p>We are erasing those lines in the name of efficiency. We are deputizing local officers to enforce federal law, paying them bonuses for performance we haven't defined, and calling anyone who asks about civil rights protections disgusting.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether immigration law should be enforced. The question is whether we enforce it in a way compatible with constitutional limits and local accountability.</p>\n\n<p>Can a local police officer, after 40 hours of training, wield immigration authority as complex as any in federal law? Should an officer answering to a local chief also answer to a federal supervisor? Can we protect civil rights when the line between local and federal power is this blurred?</p>\n\n<p>Those aren't partisan questions. They're structural ones. And they matter long after this administration, and the next, and the one after that.</p>\n\n<p>Power delegated is rarely returned. Authority granted in an emergency tends to become permanent. Extraordinary measures, once normalized, define the new ordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Forty-five agreements became 1,412. The restraint of thirty years dissolved in twelve months.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a trend line. That's a transformation. And it's happening in traffic stops and domestic calls and broken taillights across forty states.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders designed a system where power was divided because they knew it was dangerous when concentrated. They created layers of accountability because they knew authority without oversight becomes tyranny.</p>\n\n<p>We are now testing whether that design holds when we blur the layers, split the accountability, and pay local officers to pursue federal goals without defining what success looks like or who answers when it goes wrong.</p>\n\n<p>That test is happening now. In your town. With your police. Under authorities granted faster than oversight could follow.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether we notice before the lines are too blurred to see.</p>",
