      "content": "<p>The United States government is pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela. This action follows the seizure of two previous vessels carrying Venezuelan crude.</p>\n\n<p>No formal declaration of war exists. No letter of marque has been issued by Congress. No blockade has been proclaimed through diplomatic channels to neutral nations.</p>\n\n<p>Yet ships are being stopped on the high seas.</p>\n\n<p>I say this as someone who wore the uniform. The seizure of merchant vessels in international waters is an act that, throughout history, has preceded or constituted war. The British seizure of American sailors and cargo was among the causes that led to the War of 1812. Confederate commerce raiders targeting Union shipping were instruments of declared hostilities. When Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, it understood it was choosing war.</p>\n\n<p>These were not police actions. They were acts of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Sanctions Authority</p>\n\n<p>The current seizures operate under the authority of economic sanctions, primarily those imposed through executive orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. These sanctions prohibit transactions with certain Venezuelan entities and individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is straightforward: When did the interdiction of neutral shipping on the high seas become an administrative matter?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions have existed for decades. But the scope of what now happens under sanctions authorities would be unrecognizable to earlier generations. We have moved from prohibiting American companies from doing business with sanctioned entities to actively seizing vessels, often flagged to third countries, carrying goods between non-American parties.</p>\n\n<p>This expansion happened gradually. Each step was justified as necessary, proportionate, targeted. Each seizure was framed as enforcement, not escalation.</p>\n\n<p>But when enforcement requires stopping ships at sea, the question is no longer about financial compliance. It is about the projection of force beyond our borders and outside the framework that the Constitution establishes for such projections.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Understood</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power \"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\"</p>\n\n<p>Letters of marque and reprisal were the mechanism by which Congress authorized private vessels to seize enemy shipping. The Founders included this specific power because they understood that taking ships at sea was an act of such gravity it required legislative authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the President's authority as commander in chief \"would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces... while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies, all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature.\"</p>\n\n<p>The distinction was deliberate. The power to take ships, like the power to declare war, was too consequential to rest with one person.</p>\n\n<p>## The Quiet Expansion</p>\n\n<p>I served in government during a period when these authorities were expanding. The justification was always the same: We face threats that require flexibility. Traditional mechanisms are too slow. The Constitution contemplates executive action in emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>All of this contains truth. But it elides a more fundamental question.</p>\n\n<p>If the authority being exercised requires ships to be stopped, boarded, and seized, has it not crossed the threshold that the Constitution places under legislative control?</p>\n\n<p>The ships being pursued are not American-flagged. The oil being carried is not American property. The transactions being interdicted are between third parties. The legal theory is that because these transactions ultimately violate U.S. sanctions, any ship anywhere can be subject to American jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>This is not enforcement of American law within American territory. This is the assertion that American law applies extraterritorially to anyone, anywhere, whose actions we deem to violate our economic prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what we would say if another nation asserted the same authority.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela is not popular. Its government's human rights record is poor. Its economic policies have been disastrous. These facts are not in dispute.</p>\n\n<p>But constitutional principles do not depend on whether the target is sympathetic.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the United States government has the authority, through executive action alone, to interdict merchant shipping on the high seas outside any declared state of hostilities.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we have redefined what \"war powers\" means. We have decided that the seizure of vessels, historically an act of war, is now simply an administrative tool of foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then what is happening requires congressional authorization that does not currently exist.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question being avoided is this: What limits remain on executive power if the interdiction of international commerce can be conducted indefinitely, without legislative authorization, under the banner of sanctions enforcement?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions can be imposed by executive order. They can be maintained indefinitely. They can expand in scope from prohibiting American transactions to seizing third-party vessels. They require no declaration, no sunset provision, no periodic reauthorization.</p>\n\n<p>Compare this to the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces and limits such commitments to 60 days without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>The seizure of merchant vessels falls outside this framework entirely. It is treated as economic policy, not military action.</p>\n\n<p>Yet it requires warships. It involves the use of force. It is, in every practical sense, an act of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>I do not argue that sanctions are unconstitutional. I do not argue that the executive branch lacks any role in foreign affairs. I do not argue that Venezuela's government deserves support.</p>\n\n<p>I argue that the Constitution draws lines, and those lines matter.</p>\n\n<p>The power to seize ships was placed under legislative control because the Founders understood it as an act of war. That understanding has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to rename such acts so they fall outside constitutional constraints.</p>\n\n<p>When temporary measures become permanent, when extraordinary actions become routine, when the vocabulary changes but the substance remains, we are not adapting the Constitution to modern needs.</p>\n\n<p>We are evading it.</p>\n\n<p>The third tanker being pursued is not the story. The story is that we have accepted as normal what previous generations would have recognized as war, and we have done so without asking whether the constitutional architecture for such decisions still applies.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unasked, is why this matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to understand how things work when authorities want something done quickly. There are protocols. There are reviews. There are chains of command designed to ensure that even in moments of urgency, we remain a nation of laws.</p>\n\n<p>On March 15, 2025, those protocols failed.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act that evening to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order the same evening, halting the deportations until the men could have their day in court.</p>\n\n<p>The planes landed in El Salvador anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Let that fact settle. A federal judge issued an order. The executive branch ignored it. The government's defense was not that the order came too late, or that communications failed, or that some emergency made compliance impossible. The Justice Department argued that the judge had no authority to issue the order in the first place—that questions of foreign policy placed these deportations beyond judicial review.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a claim about timing. That is a claim about power.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Judge Found</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Judge Boasberg ruled that the United States government denied due process to 137 Venezuelan men it deported under the Alien Enemies Act. His opinion is careful, measured, grounded in constitutional requirement rather than political preference. The men, he found, deserved the chance to prove they were not gang members before being sent to a foreign prison. The government provided no such opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The administration will appeal. That is its right.</p>\n\n<p>But the opinion raises a question that transcends this particular case: If expedited removal allows the government to \"secretly spirit\" people to foreign custody before a court can intervene, what remains of judicial review?</p>\n\n<p>The answer the Justice Department offered in March was: nothing. When the executive acts in matters touching foreign relations, it suggested, courts should stay out.</p>\n\n<p>That position has a name. It is called unreviewable discretion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Act Itself</p>\n\n<p>The Alien Enemies Act dates to 1798. It authorizes the president, during declared war or invasion, to detain or deport nationals of hostile foreign powers. It has been used three times in our history: during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. Each time, it was invoked in the context of actual, declared war between nations.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela has not invaded the United States. Congress has not declared war. What exists instead is the government's assertion that Tren de Aragua constitutes an invasion, and that this assertion alone triggers authority under a statute designed for armed conflict between sovereign states.</p>\n\n<p>This is not originalism. This is not even creative interpretation. This is taking language written for one context and applying it to another because the language is broad enough to bear the weight.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Tren de Aragua is dangerous. Criminal organizations are dangerous. The question is whether danger alone converts police work into war, and whether calling something an invasion makes it one for constitutional purposes.</p>\n\n<p>If it does, there is no limiting principle. Any transnational criminal network becomes an invading force. Any executive can invoke wartime authority without asking Congress to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>## What Due Process Requires</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Amendment is nine words long in the relevant part: \"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not \"no citizen.\" No person.</p>\n\n<p>Due process does not mean the government cannot deport people. It means the government must provide some opportunity to contest the grounds for deportation before it acts. That opportunity can be brief. It can be limited. But it must exist.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg's ruling does not say the government was wrong to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. It does not say the men must be granted asylum, or released, or allowed to remain in the United States. It says only that they are entitled to a hearing—a chance to show that the government's factual basis for calling them gang members is mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>The administration argued that providing such hearings was impractical. The men had already been deported. They were in El Salvador, then Venezuela. Bringing them back would be costly and complicated.</p>\n\n<p>True enough.</p>\n\n<p>But the impracticality is the government's own creation. The men would still be in the United States, able to appear before an immigration judge, if the executive had not sent them to El Salvador hours after a federal court said not to.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot manufacture your own emergency and then cite the emergency as grounds for denying rights.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>This case will be remembered not for what happened to 137 Venezuelans, but for what it establishes about executive power in immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>If the government can deport people to foreign custody before a court order takes effect, and then argue that their deportation makes judicial review impractical, then every future administration has a roadmap. Act fast enough, move people far enough, and the courts cannot reach them.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a bug in the government's theory. It is the theory.</p>\n\n<p>The Justice Department did not apologize for defying Judge Boasberg's order. It argued that the order was invalid from the start—that courts have no role in reviewing deportations conducted under the Alien Enemies Act, or at least no role that can be exercised quickly enough to matter.</p>\n\n<p>If that argument prevails, the constitutional consequence is clear: There will be a category of executive action that is, for all practical purposes, unreviewable. Not because the law prohibits review, but because the government can complete the action before review occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Speed becomes immunity.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg also found probable cause to hold the administration in criminal contempt for violating his March order. The appellate court has paused that proceeding, but the question remains: What happens when the executive branch ignores a judicial order?</p>\n\n<p>In a system of separated powers, the answer cannot be \"nothing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Contempt is not a political weapon. It is the judiciary's tool for enforcing its own judgments. Without it, court orders become suggestions. The executive obeys when it agrees, defies when it does not, and suffers no consequence either way.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a constitutional republic operates. That is how power consolidates.</p>\n\n<p>The men in this case have since been returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange. Their immediate circumstances have changed. But the precedent remains. The next group of people subjected to expedited removal under the Alien Enemies Act, or any other authority the executive claims is beyond judicial reach, will face the same problem: by the time a court can rule, they will already be gone.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>This is not about immigration policy. Reasonable people can disagree about how many people should be admitted, under what conditions, and what should happen to those who enter unlawfully. Those are legitimate political questions.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether the executive branch must allow judicial review of its factual determinations before acting, or whether asserting urgency and foreign policy concerns exempts it from that requirement.</p>\n\n<p>If the latter, then we have redefined what \"due process\" means. It no longer means an opportunity to be heard before deprivation. It means an opportunity the government will provide if convenient, and decline if not.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a small change. It is a transformation of the relationship between the citizen—or the person, because the Constitution says person—and the state.</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist 47 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands\" is \"the very definition of tyranny.\" He was describing concentration within a single branch. But the same danger exists when one branch can act beyond the reach of the others—when it moves too fast for law to catch it, and then argues that speed itself makes accountability impossible.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that principle tested.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether Judge Boasberg's ruling will stand, or whether the government's theory will prevail: that in matters the executive declares urgent, involving people it declares dangerous, the constitutional requirement of due process dissolves into discretion.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",
