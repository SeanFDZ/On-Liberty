      "content": "<p>The United States government is pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela. This action follows the seizure of two previous vessels carrying Venezuelan crude.</p>\n\n<p>No formal declaration of war exists. No letter of marque has been issued by Congress. No blockade has been proclaimed through diplomatic channels to neutral nations.</p>\n\n<p>Yet ships are being stopped on the high seas.</p>\n\n<p>I say this as someone who wore the uniform. The seizure of merchant vessels in international waters is an act that, throughout history, has preceded or constituted war. The British seizure of American sailors and cargo was among the causes that led to the War of 1812. Confederate commerce raiders targeting Union shipping were instruments of declared hostilities. When Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, it understood it was choosing war.</p>\n\n<p>These were not police actions. They were acts of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Sanctions Authority</p>\n\n<p>The current seizures operate under the authority of economic sanctions, primarily those imposed through executive orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. These sanctions prohibit transactions with certain Venezuelan entities and individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is straightforward: When did the interdiction of neutral shipping on the high seas become an administrative matter?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions have existed for decades. But the scope of what now happens under sanctions authorities would be unrecognizable to earlier generations. We have moved from prohibiting American companies from doing business with sanctioned entities to actively seizing vessels, often flagged to third countries, carrying goods between non-American parties.</p>\n\n<p>This expansion happened gradually. Each step was justified as necessary, proportionate, targeted. Each seizure was framed as enforcement, not escalation.</p>\n\n<p>But when enforcement requires stopping ships at sea, the question is no longer about financial compliance. It is about the projection of force beyond our borders and outside the framework that the Constitution establishes for such projections.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Understood</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power \"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\"</p>\n\n<p>Letters of marque and reprisal were the mechanism by which Congress authorized private vessels to seize enemy shipping. The Founders included this specific power because they understood that taking ships at sea was an act of such gravity it required legislative authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the President's authority as commander in chief \"would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces... while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies, all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature.\"</p>\n\n<p>The distinction was deliberate. The power to take ships, like the power to declare war, was too consequential to rest with one person.</p>\n\n<p>## The Quiet Expansion</p>\n\n<p>I served in government during a period when these authorities were expanding. The justification was always the same: We face threats that require flexibility. Traditional mechanisms are too slow. The Constitution contemplates executive action in emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>All of this contains truth. But it elides a more fundamental question.</p>\n\n<p>If the authority being exercised requires ships to be stopped, boarded, and seized, has it not crossed the threshold that the Constitution places under legislative control?</p>\n\n<p>The ships being pursued are not American-flagged. The oil being carried is not American property. The transactions being interdicted are between third parties. The legal theory is that because these transactions ultimately violate U.S. sanctions, any ship anywhere can be subject to American jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>This is not enforcement of American law within American territory. This is the assertion that American law applies extraterritorially to anyone, anywhere, whose actions we deem to violate our economic prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what we would say if another nation asserted the same authority.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela is not popular. Its government's human rights record is poor. Its economic policies have been disastrous. These facts are not in dispute.</p>\n\n<p>But constitutional principles do not depend on whether the target is sympathetic.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the United States government has the authority, through executive action alone, to interdict merchant shipping on the high seas outside any declared state of hostilities.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we have redefined what \"war powers\" means. We have decided that the seizure of vessels, historically an act of war, is now simply an administrative tool of foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then what is happening requires congressional authorization that does not currently exist.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question being avoided is this: What limits remain on executive power if the interdiction of international commerce can be conducted indefinitely, without legislative authorization, under the banner of sanctions enforcement?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions can be imposed by executive order. They can be maintained indefinitely. They can expand in scope from prohibiting American transactions to seizing third-party vessels. They require no declaration, no sunset provision, no periodic reauthorization.</p>\n\n<p>Compare this to the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces and limits such commitments to 60 days without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>The seizure of merchant vessels falls outside this framework entirely. It is treated as economic policy, not military action.</p>\n\n<p>Yet it requires warships. It involves the use of force. It is, in every practical sense, an act of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>I do not argue that sanctions are unconstitutional. I do not argue that the executive branch lacks any role in foreign affairs. I do not argue that Venezuela's government deserves support.</p>\n\n<p>I argue that the Constitution draws lines, and those lines matter.</p>\n\n<p>The power to seize ships was placed under legislative control because the Founders understood it as an act of war. That understanding has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to rename such acts so they fall outside constitutional constraints.</p>\n\n<p>When temporary measures become permanent, when extraordinary actions become routine, when the vocabulary changes but the substance remains, we are not adapting the Constitution to modern needs.</p>\n\n<p>We are evading it.</p>\n\n<p>The third tanker being pursued is not the story. The story is that we have accepted as normal what previous generations would have recognized as war, and we have done so without asking whether the constitutional architecture for such decisions still applies.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unasked, is why this matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to understand how things work when authorities want something done quickly. There are protocols. There are reviews. There are chains of command designed to ensure that even in moments of urgency, we remain a nation of laws.</p>\n\n<p>On March 15, 2025, those protocols failed.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act that evening to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order the same evening, halting the deportations until the men could have their day in court.</p>\n\n<p>The planes landed in El Salvador anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Let that fact settle. A federal judge issued an order. The executive branch ignored it. The government's defense was not that the order came too late, or that communications failed, or that some emergency made compliance impossible. The Justice Department argued that the judge had no authority to issue the order in the first place—that questions of foreign policy placed these deportations beyond judicial review.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a claim about timing. That is a claim about power.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Judge Found</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Judge Boasberg ruled that the United States government denied due process to 137 Venezuelan men it deported under the Alien Enemies Act. His opinion is careful, measured, grounded in constitutional requirement rather than political preference. The men, he found, deserved the chance to prove they were not gang members before being sent to a foreign prison. The government provided no such opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The administration will appeal. That is its right.</p>\n\n<p>But the opinion raises a question that transcends this particular case: If expedited removal allows the government to \"secretly spirit\" people to foreign custody before a court can intervene, what remains of judicial review?</p>\n\n<p>The answer the Justice Department offered in March was: nothing. When the executive acts in matters touching foreign relations, it suggested, courts should stay out.</p>\n\n<p>That position has a name. It is called unreviewable discretion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Act Itself</p>\n\n<p>The Alien Enemies Act dates to 1798. It authorizes the president, during declared war or invasion, to detain or deport nationals of hostile foreign powers. It has been used three times in our history: during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. Each time, it was invoked in the context of actual, declared war between nations.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela has not invaded the United States. Congress has not declared war. What exists instead is the government's assertion that Tren de Aragua constitutes an invasion, and that this assertion alone triggers authority under a statute designed for armed conflict between sovereign states.</p>\n\n<p>This is not originalism. This is not even creative interpretation. This is taking language written for one context and applying it to another because the language is broad enough to bear the weight.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Tren de Aragua is dangerous. Criminal organizations are dangerous. The question is whether danger alone converts police work into war, and whether calling something an invasion makes it one for constitutional purposes.</p>\n\n<p>If it does, there is no limiting principle. Any transnational criminal network becomes an invading force. Any executive can invoke wartime authority without asking Congress to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>## What Due Process Requires</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Amendment is nine words long in the relevant part: \"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not \"no citizen.\" No person.</p>\n\n<p>Due process does not mean the government cannot deport people. It means the government must provide some opportunity to contest the grounds for deportation before it acts. That opportunity can be brief. It can be limited. But it must exist.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg's ruling does not say the government was wrong to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. It does not say the men must be granted asylum, or released, or allowed to remain in the United States. It says only that they are entitled to a hearing—a chance to show that the government's factual basis for calling them gang members is mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>The administration argued that providing such hearings was impractical. The men had already been deported. They were in El Salvador, then Venezuela. Bringing them back would be costly and complicated.</p>\n\n<p>True enough.</p>\n\n<p>But the impracticality is the government's own creation. The men would still be in the United States, able to appear before an immigration judge, if the executive had not sent them to El Salvador hours after a federal court said not to.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot manufacture your own emergency and then cite the emergency as grounds for denying rights.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>This case will be remembered not for what happened to 137 Venezuelans, but for what it establishes about executive power in immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>If the government can deport people to foreign custody before a court order takes effect, and then argue that their deportation makes judicial review impractical, then every future administration has a roadmap. Act fast enough, move people far enough, and the courts cannot reach them.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a bug in the government's theory. It is the theory.</p>\n\n<p>The Justice Department did not apologize for defying Judge Boasberg's order. It argued that the order was invalid from the start—that courts have no role in reviewing deportations conducted under the Alien Enemies Act, or at least no role that can be exercised quickly enough to matter.</p>\n\n<p>If that argument prevails, the constitutional consequence is clear: There will be a category of executive action that is, for all practical purposes, unreviewable. Not because the law prohibits review, but because the government can complete the action before review occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Speed becomes immunity.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg also found probable cause to hold the administration in criminal contempt for violating his March order. The appellate court has paused that proceeding, but the question remains: What happens when the executive branch ignores a judicial order?</p>\n\n<p>In a system of separated powers, the answer cannot be \"nothing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Contempt is not a political weapon. It is the judiciary's tool for enforcing its own judgments. Without it, court orders become suggestions. The executive obeys when it agrees, defies when it does not, and suffers no consequence either way.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a constitutional republic operates. That is how power consolidates.</p>\n\n<p>The men in this case have since been returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange. Their immediate circumstances have changed. But the precedent remains. The next group of people subjected to expedited removal under the Alien Enemies Act, or any other authority the executive claims is beyond judicial reach, will face the same problem: by the time a court can rule, they will already be gone.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>This is not about immigration policy. Reasonable people can disagree about how many people should be admitted, under what conditions, and what should happen to those who enter unlawfully. Those are legitimate political questions.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether the executive branch must allow judicial review of its factual determinations before acting, or whether asserting urgency and foreign policy concerns exempts it from that requirement.</p>\n\n<p>If the latter, then we have redefined what \"due process\" means. It no longer means an opportunity to be heard before deprivation. It means an opportunity the government will provide if convenient, and decline if not.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a small change. It is a transformation of the relationship between the citizen—or the person, because the Constitution says person—and the state.</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist 47 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands\" is \"the very definition of tyranny.\" He was describing concentration within a single branch. But the same danger exists when one branch can act beyond the reach of the others—when it moves too fast for law to catch it, and then argues that speed itself makes accountability impossible.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that principle tested.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether Judge Boasberg's ruling will stand, or whether the government's theory will prevail: that in matters the executive declares urgent, involving people it declares dangerous, the constitutional requirement of due process dissolves into discretion.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in uniform. I understand operational necessity. I also understand the difference between a military operation conducted under legal authority and the seizure of assets that belongs in a different century entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The United States has deployed 15,000 troops to the Caribbean, ordered a naval blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers, seized at least two vessels, announced it will keep or sell both the ships and their cargo, and stated it is pursuing a third. The largest deployment to the region since the 1989 Panama invasion. The president has declared he will appropriate the property of a sovereign nation without compensation, without judicial process, without treaty authorization.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Venezuela's government. This is about what power claims it may do.</p>\n\n<p>## The Authority Question</p>\n\n<p>The stated justification is drug interdiction. Fentanyl, cocaine, organized crime. Legitimate national security concerns, all of them. But the constitutional framework for using military force abroad is narrow and specific. Congress declares war. The president may act in genuine emergencies under the War Powers Resolution. Treaty obligations create mutual defense commitments within defined boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is none of these things.</p>\n\n<p>A blockade is an act of war under international law. Seizing commercial vessels on the high seas and declaring you will sell their cargo is, as Venezuela's UN ambassador noted, difficult to distinguish from piracy. The United States does not recognize the Maduro government as legitimate. Fair enough. But non-recognition does not grant authority to appropriate property. If it did, we could seize the assets of every government we consider illegitimate. That is not law. That is might.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Ambassador to the UN offered this defense: \"Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claims to power and his narco-terrorist activities.\" Perhaps true. But the Constitution does not authorize the president to decide which foreign leaders are legitimate, seize their nations' resources, and redistribute them as he sees fit. That power, if it exists at all, would require congressional authorization. It would require a legal framework. It would require something other than a presidential announcement that we are taking ships and keeping what we find.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern That Should Concern Us</p>\n\n<p>This is the fourth such operation in recent months. More than 20 vessels targeted in the Pacific and Caribbean. At least 90 people killed in strikes the administration describes as counter-gang operations. Some legal experts suggest these actions may violate the laws of armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether drug trafficking is a serious problem. It is. The question is whether the seriousness of the problem justifies abandoning the legal constraints that distinguish a republic from an empire.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the mechanism. The president declares a threat. The president orders military action. The president seizes property. The president announces he will liquidate that property for U.S. benefit. Where in that sequence is congressional authorization? Where is judicial review? Where is the check on executive power that prevents \"national security\" from becoming a blank authorization for anything the president deems necessary?</p>\n\n<p>This is not hypothetical. I watched extraordinary authorities granted after September 11th become permanent features of government. Temporary surveillance powers that were never relinquished. Detention policies that started as emergency measures and became standard procedure. The slow migration from \"we must do this now\" to \"this is simply what we do.\"</p>\n\n<p>## What the Framers Understood</p>\n\n<p>The men who wrote the Constitution had recent experience with unchecked executive power. They had lived under a king who claimed the authority to seize property, wage war, and govern by decree. They designed a system specifically to prevent that concentration of power in one person.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison, Federalist 47: \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"</p>\n\n<p>We are watching the accumulation Madison warned against. Not through dramatic coup, but through the quiet assertion that the president may do what he judges necessary. That military force may be deployed, ships seized, and property liquidated based on executive determination alone. That the complexity of modern threats requires we trust the judgment of whoever holds the office.</p>\n\n<p>The Framers would not have trusted that judgment. They did not design a system that required trusting it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent</p>\n\n<p>Russia's UN ambassador called this \"a template for future acts of force against Latin American states.\" He is not wrong to worry. If the United States may seize the assets of any nation whose government we consider illegitimate, whose oil sales we believe fund activities we oppose, then we have announced a doctrine with no limiting principle.</p>\n\n<p>Today it is Venezuela and drug trafficking. Tomorrow it could be any nation, any resource, any stated justification. The legal architecture, once abandoned, is difficult to rebuild. The precedent, once set, becomes permission.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics drift toward something else. Not through sudden transformation, but through the steady expansion of what power claims it may do without asking permission.</p>\n\n<p>## What Should Be Asked</p>\n\n<p>Is there congressional authorization for this blockade?</p>\n\n<p>Under what legal framework does the president claim authority to seize foreign commercial vessels and appropriate their cargo?</p>\n\n<p>If this action is justified by Venezuela's status as a narco-state, what prevents the same reasoning from applying to any nation we accuse of facilitating drug trade?</p>\n\n<p>Who reviews these decisions? Who checks them?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is \"the president decides,\" then we have answered a different question than we intended.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>The argument will be made that this is different. That Venezuela is uniquely problematic, that Maduro is uniquely illegitimate, that the drug crisis is uniquely urgent. Perhaps. But constitutional principle does not operate on a curve graded by how much we dislike the target.</p>\n\n<p>Either we are a nation that operates under law, or we are a nation that operates under power. Either military force abroad requires legal authorization, or it requires only executive will. Either property seizures follow due process, or they follow presidential announcement.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot be both. And we are deciding, right now, which we will be.</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath did not include an asterisk for difficult cases. It did not include an exception for serious threats. It meant what it said: that the framework matters more than the outcome, that the process protects everyone, and that power exercised without legal constraint is not legitimate power regardless of its objective.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about defending Venezuela's government. This is about defending the system that prevents any government, including ours, from doing whatever it believes necessary.</p>\n\n<p>That system is being tested. The test is happening now.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The Department of Justice announced this week that it has discovered more than a million additional documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. They promise release \"in the coming days and weeks.\" The statement did not explain how these documents, which presumably existed during the initial review, were only now discovered.</p>\n\n<p>That's the detail that matters.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Epstein. The crimes are known. The victims are known. The dead cannot be brought to trial.</p>\n\n<p>This is about what a government owes its people when it says \"we have disclosed everything,\" and then months later says \"we have found a million more pages.\"</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in government service. I've reviewed classified materials under deadline pressure. I know what \"we're working around the clock\" means when spoken by lawyers protecting institutional interests rather than serving constitutional obligations.</p>\n\n<p>It means the clock started late.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We've Seen Before</p>\n\n<p>Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The law was specific: release all documents, redact only to protect victims and active investigations, do not redact to prevent embarrassment or reputational harm, and meet a deadline of December 19.</p>\n\n<p>The Department missed the deadline.</p>\n\n<p>The initial releases were heavily redacted, including names of possible co-conspirators whom the FBI had served with subpoenas in 2019. Lawmakers from both parties objected. The law clearly prohibited those redactions.</p>\n\n<p>Now we learn there are a million more documents that somehow weren't part of the initial inventory.</p>\n\n<p>The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required full disclosure by 2017. In 2017, agencies requested more time. They are still requesting more time. Documents from 1963 remain classified in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is this: Congress passes a transparency law. Agencies comply minimally. Years pass. The public's attention moves on. What was mandatory becomes negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>The law does not enforce itself.</p>\n\n<p>## What \"Review\" Means</p>\n\n<p>The Department says lawyers are \"working around the clock\" to review these newly discovered documents. This is presented as diligence. It is more accurately described as delay.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act is explicit about what may be redacted: victim identities and information that would compromise active criminal investigations. That's it. The law specifically states that embarrassment and reputational harm are not grounds for redaction.</p>\n\n<p>If the law means what it says, review should be straightforward. Find victim names, redact them. Check for overlap with ongoing prosecutions, redact those specific items. Release everything else.</p>\n\n<p>If review takes \"a few more weeks\" for a million documents, that's not document review. That's interest balancing. It's deciding which powerful people can be protected under a permissive interpretation of \"active investigation.\" It's determining how much the statute really means.</p>\n\n<p>This is how law stops being law and becomes suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>I've been part of classification reviews. When institutions want transparency, documents move quickly. When they don't, every page requires three meetings and a legal memo.</p>\n\n<p>Speed reveals intent.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Co-Conspirators</p>\n\n<p>Embedded in the already-released documents are FBI emails from 2019 mentioning ten possible co-conspirators. Six had been served with subpoenas. Three in Florida. One in Boston. One in New York. One in Connecticut.</p>\n\n<p>Their names are redacted.</p>\n\n<p>The law prohibits redaction to prevent embarrassment. Were these six people charged? If not, on what basis did the FBI decline prosecution? Those are the internal communications and memos the statute specifically requires.</p>\n\n<p>Epstein died in federal custody in 2019. Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2022. The investigation is not new. The FBI identified possible co-conspirators, served them with subpoenas, and made charging decisions years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Why are we still waiting to know who they were and why they weren't charged?</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a question about Jeffrey Epstein. It's a question about whether law applies differently to people with power and proximity to power.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we do not have equal justice. We have a system where connection determines consequence. And if that's the system, citizens deserve to know it plainly rather than discover it through redaction patterns and missed deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Requires</p>\n\n<p>Transparency is not a favor governments grant when convenient. It is a structural requirement of legitimate authority.</p>\n\n<p>When Congress passes a law requiring disclosure, that law represents the people's judgment that they are entitled to know what their government did and did not do. The executive branch does not have discretion to comply partially or slowly unless the law provides that discretion.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act provided limited discretion: protect victims and active investigations. Everything else must be released.</p>\n\n<p>If a million documents were somehow overlooked, that is not a reason for more time. It is evidence that the initial review was inadequate. The remedy is not another months-long review at the same pace. The remedy is to release everything not clearly covered by the two statutory exceptions, and let citizens see what their government has been doing.</p>\n\n<p>Trust is not rebuilt through promises of future transparency. It is rebuilt through present action.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>This case will clarify something important. Either the law means what it says, or it means what is convenient.</p>\n\n<p>If names are redacted because releasing them would be embarrassing, the law has been broken, and Congress should enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>If the \"review process\" continues indefinitely while public attention wanes, we will know that transparency laws are performative, not binding.</p>\n\n<p>If co-conspirators who were investigated but not charged remain unnamed because they are powerful or connected, we will know that equal justice is an aspiration rather than a practice.</p>\n\n<p>The facts are straightforward. The law is clear. What happens next will tell us whether clarity matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I've worked in government buildings named for people who served this country. You walk through those halls conscious of the names on the walls, the portraits in the lobbies, the dedications carved in stone. They aren't decorations. They're reminders of what the institution is supposed to serve.</p>\n\n<p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was created by federal law. Congress authorized it. Congress funded it. Congress named it after a president who had been assassinated in office. The statute establishing it, Public Law 88-260, enacted January 23, 1964, declares it \"a living memorial\" and \"the National Center for the Performing Arts.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not political preference. That's law.</p>\n\n<p>Now the sitting president has placed his own name on that memorial. A board he reconstituted voted unanimously to rename it. A congresswoman designated by statute as a board member says she was muted when she tried to object. The name went up on the building within hours.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about partisan alignment. This is about whether federal law governs federal property, or whether control of appointments means control of outcomes previously thought to be fixed by statute.</p>\n\n<p>## The Legal Question Nobody Is Answering</p>\n\n<p>Representative Beatty's lawsuit argues that renaming the Kennedy Center requires an act of Congress, not a board resolution. The White House says the board acted properly under its authority.</p>\n\n<p>That's a factual legal question with a factual legal answer.</p>\n\n<p>Either the authorizing statute allows the board to change the name of the institution, or it doesn't. Either Congress retains authority over the designation of federal memorials it creates, or control passes entirely to whoever holds appointment power over the board.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what we know: Public Law 88-260 names the institution. It doesn't delegate naming authority to the board. It establishes the center as a memorial to John F. Kennedy. The Supreme Court has long held that when Congress creates something by statute and specifies its essential characteristics, those characteristics cannot be altered except by Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The board has authority over operations, programming, fundraising. That's governance. Changing the name of a congressionally designated memorial is not governance. It's revision of the statute itself.</p>\n\n<p>If a board vote can rename a federal memorial established by law, then law is subordinate to appointment power. That's not a small shift. That's the difference between a government of laws and a government of loyalties.</p>\n\n<p>## How Boards Become Instruments</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after taking office, President Trump removed multiple Kennedy Center board members and replaced them with appointees. Thirty-four of fifty-seven members now serve at his appointment. His close adviser became board president. He became board chairman.</p>\n\n<p>That's within presidential authority. Appointment power is real power.</p>\n\n<p>But when appointment power converts a statutory board into a unanimous instrument, we're watching something beyond normal governance. When a congresswoman says she was silenced during a vote to alter what Congress created by law, we're watching process become performance.</p>\n\n<p>The White House statement justifies the name change by citing Trump's financial support for the center, his securing of congressional appropriations, his leadership of renovations. All of that may be true. None of it changes what statute requires.</p>\n\n<p>You don't earn the right to rename federal memorials by funding them. If that were the standard, every major donor could demand naming rights over national institutions. The Lincoln Memorial would be available for the highest bidder with enough friends in the right positions.</p>\n\n<p>This is why memorials are created by law, not by board resolution.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We're Watching</p>\n\n<p>This isn't the first time statutory constraints have dissolved under appointment power. It won't be the last.</p>\n\n<p>What's being normalized is the idea that control over an institution's board means control over the institution's identity, regardless of what the statute establishing it provides. That the person who appoints can become the thing appointed. That what Congress designates by law can be redesignated by voice vote if enough board seats change hands.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this pattern before, not in memorials but in regulatory agencies, in inspector general offices, in bodies designed to operate with some independence from the executive. First, the appointments change. Then the interpretations shift. Then what was considered legally fixed becomes practically negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>Each step seems defensible in isolation. This appointment was lawful. That vote was procedurally proper. This interpretation is within discretion.</p>\n\n<p>But the cumulative effect is the conversion of institutions from entities bound by statute into extensions of whoever controls the appointments.</p>\n\n<p>## What Joe Kennedy III Said</p>\n\n<p>Joe Kennedy III, former congressman and grandnephew of the president whose name Congress placed on the center, said: \"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial.\"</p>\n\n<p>He's right about the principle. The question is whether the principle still governs.</p>\n\n<p>If a board vote can rename the Kennedy Center, can a board vote rename Arlington National Cemetery? Can it redesignate the Washington Monument? Can it alter the Jefferson Memorial? All are federal property. All were designated by acts of Congress. All have boards or commissions that could, if appointment power is sufficient, vote to revise what Congress established.</p>\n\n<p>The answer should be no, because federal law constrains federal boards. But if the answer is yes when the votes align, then we've redefined what \"established by law\" means. It means established until a different political coalition controls the appointments.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Here</p>\n\n<p>A lawsuit will determine whether Representative Beatty is correct that statute prevents what the board approved. The court will decide whether congressional designation of a memorial is binding or advisory, whether a board created to govern operations can alter the institution's statutory identity, whether appointment power extends to rewriting the terms under which institutions were created.</p>\n\n<p>That decision matters beyond one building.</p>\n\n<p>If courts hold that boards have inherent authority to rename institutions regardless of statutory language, then every federal entity designated by Congress becomes contingent on who holds appointment power at any given time. Memorials become negotiable. Statutory designations become suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>If courts hold that Congress retains authority over what it creates by law unless it explicitly delegates naming authority, then law still constrains boards, and memorials remain what Congress made them.</p>\n\n<p>The broader question is whether we still distinguish between operating an institution and redefining it, between managing within statutory bounds and rewriting the statute through board action, between normal exercise of appointment power and conversion of that power into control over an institution's legal identity.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction used to be clear. If it's eroding, we should notice.</p>\n\n<p>The name is on the building now. The website is changed. The decision has been executed before the lawsuit can be heard. That's not unusual in modern governance, but it's telling. When changes happen faster than law can review them, execution becomes the argument for legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about honoring one president or another. This is about whether federal law still governs federal property when appointment power says otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>That question, in a republic, should have only one answer.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have watched governments fall. I have seen coups unfold. I have served in regions where the difference between legitimate authority and raw power was measured in the willingness to use force against citizens.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in Myanmar is not an election. It is a performance of legitimacy staged at gunpoint.</p>\n\n<p>The military junta is holding what it calls \"phased elections\" beginning December 28. Nearly 100 people have been arrested for questioning this process. Some face prison for clicking \"like\" on social media posts critical of the vote. The opposition National League for Democracy is banned. Its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been imprisoned since the 2021 coup. Her son recently told reporters, \"For all I know, she could be dead.\"</p>\n\n<p>The military admits the vote will not be held in half the country, the contested and rebel-held areas.</p>\n\n<p>The United Nations Secretary General asked the obvious question: \"Is there anyone who believes that there will be free and fair elections in Myanmar?\"</p>\n\n<p>But here is the question beneath that question: What happens when a government performs the rituals of democracy while systematically destroying its substance?</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Myanmar's internal politics. This is about the mechanics of legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>**The Architecture of Sham Democracy**</p>\n\n<p>Elections are not merely procedures. They are the foundational mechanism by which free people delegate authority and retain the power to revoke it. When a government holds an election it controls completely, bans opposition parties, imprisons critics, and deploys force to ensure the desired outcome, it is not seeking the consent of the governed. It is demanding the performance of consent.</p>\n\n<p>The junta has passed laws criminalizing \"interference\" in the election. That word carries the full weight of state power: 200 arrests and counting for social media posts, for expressing doubt, for failing to participate in the charade.</p>\n\n<p>This is not election administration. This is compelled speech.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" The entire structure of constitutional government rests on the assumption that those who hold power must be accountable to those they govern. That accountability requires more than the theater of voting. It requires the genuine possibility of losing power.</p>\n\n<p>What Myanmar's military has constructed is a system where elections exist not as instruments of accountability but as rituals of submission.</p>\n\n<p>**The Exhaustion of Resistance**</p>\n\n<p>Here is what five years of civil war does to a population: it creates a longing for anything that resembles stability, even if that stability is the boot heel of military rule.</p>\n\n<p>Analyst David Mathieson reports hearing from citizens who say, \"We hate the regime, but at least they've got a plan, they've got a way to kind of get us out of this and stabilize.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not endorsement. That is capitulation born of exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p>This is how extraordinary measures become normalized. Not through persuasion or even through force alone, but through the grinding down of alternatives until people accept unfreedom as the price of predictability.</p>\n\n<p>Ko Ta Mar, a doctor who became a rebel commander, calls the election \"like injecting steroids into a patient. The pain can be eased temporarily, but it will be worse in the long term.\"</p>\n\n<p>He is describing the difference between symptom relief and cure, between the appearance of legitimacy and its substance. But after nearly five years of war, economic collapse, and displacement affecting millions, many citizens simply want the pain to stop, even temporarily, even if it means accepting a government they did not choose.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Myanmar's people prefer the junta. The question is whether they have been given any meaningful choice at all.</p>\n\n<p>**When Legitimacy Becomes Transactional**</p>\n\n<p>China has endorsed Myanmar's election. So has Russia. India maintains ambiguous support. Beijing's calculation is coldly practical: the military junta is \"a necessary evil\" that serves Chinese strategic interests better than continued chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Yun Sun of the Stimson Center explains China's position: \"Five years of civil war did not kick them out, and the Chinese will not tilt the balance of power in a way that the military will be forced out.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is legitimacy as transaction. Not legitimacy earned through the consent of the governed, but legitimacy purchased through the endorsement of powerful neighbors who value stability over freedom.</p>\n\n<p>China has pressured ethnic armed groups to stop fighting the junta. It has restricted weapons supplies to opposition forces. It has treated Myanmar's election not as a question of democratic principle but as an instrument of regional order.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question here extends beyond Myanmar's borders: When powerful states recognize and validate governments that lack domestic legitimacy, do they create a separate category of international legitimacy that exists independent of popular consent?</p>\n\n<p>This is not a new question. It was the question at the heart of the Cold War, when the United States and Soviet Union both propped up client regimes regardless of how those regimes came to power. But it remains urgent because it determines whether popular sovereignty is a universal principle or merely a preferred arrangement in friendly nations.</p>\n\n<p>**What Is Being Normalized**</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's election will likely produce a parliament dominated by the military's proxy party. The junta will declare the result a mandate. Some nations will accept that claim. The military will use the election as evidence of restored constitutional order, even as opposition leaders remain in prison and half the country remains too dangerous to vote.</p>\n\n<p>What is being established here is a precedent: that the forms of democracy can substitute for its substance, that elections can exist without genuine choice, that governments can claim legitimacy through processes they control completely.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an Asian problem or a developing world problem. It is the central question of republican government: whether authority derives from the consent of the governed or merely from the successful monopolization of force.</p>\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin, emerging from the Constitutional Convention in 1787, was asked what kind of government the delegates had created. He replied: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"</p>\n\n<p>The keeping of a republic requires constant vigilance against the substitution of process for principle, against the performance of democracy without its substance, against elections that function as referenda on submission rather than instruments of choice.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's military is gambling that exhaustion will produce acquiescence, that the appearance of normalcy will be accepted as normalcy itself, that international recognition will substitute for domestic legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>The gamble may work. Five years of war have worn down resistance. China's support provides economic lifelines and diplomatic cover. The opposition remains fractured and outgunned.</p>\n\n<p>But what succeeds tactically may fail constitutionally. A government that must imprison critics to hold elections, that must ban opposition parties to ensure victory, that must control half the country by force to govern the other half through votes, has not achieved legitimacy. It has achieved compliance.</p>\n\n<p>The difference matters. Compliance is temporary. It lasts only as long as force can be maintained. Legitimacy is durable. It survives changes in leadership and shifts in power because it rests on consent rather than coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's military is constructing a house of cards and calling it a foundation. The structure may stand for years. It may even function as government. But it will not be legitimate, no matter how many elections it holds or how many foreign powers recognize the result.</p>\n\n<p>The test is simple: Can the people change their government through peaceful means? If the answer is no, the government does not rest on consent. If the government does not rest on consent, it is not legitimate, no matter what forms it observes or what elections it holds.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a partisan claim. That is constitutional bedrock.</p>\n\n<p>The question for the rest of us is whether we are prepared to say so.</p>",

The alarm sounds. On screen, missiles rise in balls of fire. Mushroom clouds blossom across the planet.</p>\n\n<p>It's a macabre tourist attraction now. Once it was Ukraine's insurance policy.</p>\n\n<p>In 1994, Ukraine possessed the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. Ten years later, every warhead was gone, dismantled under the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and Britain. The terms were clear: Ukraine would surrender its nuclear weapons. In exchange, the three co-signers guaranteed Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>Russia invaded in 2014. It invaded again in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a story about nuclear proliferation. This is a story about what happens when security guarantees are worth less than the paper they're written on.</p>\n\n<p>**When Assurances Replace Obligation**</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum was not a treaty. That matters.</p>\n\n<p>A treaty requires Senate ratification under Article II of the Constitution. It creates binding obligations enforceable under international law. The Budapest Memorandum was a political commitment, a gentleman's agreement among nuclear powers that one of them would not invade the country that had just given up the means to defend itself.</p>\n\n<p>President Clinton called it \"a hopeful and historic breakthrough.\" Ukraine's then-president, Leonid Kravchuk, believed the word of three nuclear powers meant something.</p>\n\n<p>The museum guide, Hennadiy Vladimirovitch Fil, says hardly anyone of a certain age leaves without cursing. They understand now what they gave away. Denmark's ambassador to Kyiv, visiting the museum, calls it \"a disgrace.\" Even Clinton later admitted: \"I feel terrible about it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Words without enforcement are wishes. Security without accountability is theater.</p>\n\n<p>**The Architecture of Deterrence**</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that republics survive not through the goodwill of other nations but through the credible threat of force. As Hamilton wrote in Federalist 34, \"A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine's nuclear arsenal was precisely such a power. Ten ICBMs, each carrying ten warheads, each capable of obliterating 77,000 square miles. These were not symbolic weapons. They were instruments of mutual assured destruction, the Cold War doctrine that kept the peace precisely because no rational actor would risk annihilation.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine surrendered that deterrent on the promise that it wouldn't need it.</p>\n\n<p>Russia tested the promise in 2014 with Crimea. The West condemned the action but took no military steps to reverse it. The promise held as long as Russia chose not to break it further. In 2022, Russia broke it entirely.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when deterrence rests on assurances rather than capability. The strong do what they can. The weak suffer what they must.</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Good Faith**</p>\n\n<p>Museum visitors watch a simulation of nuclear war: oxygen depleting from the atmosphere, life ending on the planet. Fil is grateful it never came to that. But he regrets that Ukraine gave up its weapons.</p>\n\n<p>The regret is not about wanting nuclear war. It's about recognizing that the international order operates not on justice but on power.</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum assumed good faith from all signatories. It assumed that Russia, having just emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union, would respect the sovereignty of its neighbors. It assumed that the United States and Britain, having brokered the deal, would enforce it if Russia didn't.</p>\n\n<p>All three assumptions were wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution does not assume good faith. It constructs a government on the premise that people are not angels. As Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>The international order assumed angels. Ukraine is paying the price.</p>\n\n<p>**What This Museum Teaches**</p>\n\n<p>The Museum of Strategic Missile Forces is a warning in concrete and steel. It documents how a nation voluntarily disarmed, how it trusted written assurances from nuclear powers, and how those assurances collapsed the moment they were tested.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is now demanding \"ironclad security guarantees\" as part of any peace deal with Russia. The word \"ironclad\" is doing heavy lifting. What makes a guarantee ironclad? Not signatures. Not diplomatic language. Not the prestige of the signatories.</p>\n\n<p>Guarantees are ironclad when they are backed by the credible threat of enforcement. Treaties work when violation carries consequences that the violator cannot afford. The Budapest Memorandum failed because Russia calculated, correctly, that it could invade without triggering a military response from the other signatories.</p>\n\n<p>A museum guide who once served in the Soviet rocket forces now takes tourists underground to press a launch button that does nothing. The missiles are gone. The silos are filled with concrete. The deterrent is a historical exhibit.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when nations trade power for promises.</p>\n\n<p>**The Constitutional Question**</p>\n\n<p>The United States did not violate the Constitution by signing the Budapest Memorandum. The executive branch has authority to conduct foreign policy and enter into non-treaty agreements. But the decision to use a memorandum rather than a treaty meant that the commitment had no force of law, no mechanism for enforcement, and no obligation beyond diplomatic pressure.</p>\n\n<p>The Senate never voted on whether to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity. The American people never consented to a binding obligation. The memorandum allowed the executive branch to project the appearance of a security guarantee without accepting the accountability that comes with one.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about whether the United States should have gone to war to defend Ukraine in 2014 or 2022. This is about whether we should have made a promise we had no intention of keeping.</p>\n\n<p>When the executive branch makes commitments that look like treaties but lack treaty obligations, it creates confusion about what America actually stands behind. It encourages allies to trust assurances that may not hold. It teaches adversaries that American promises are negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>The museum in Ukraine stands as a monument to that confusion.</p>\n\n<p>**What Visitors Learn**</p>\n\n<p>They learn that nuclear weapons are terrible. They learn that the Cold War arms race brought humanity to the edge of extinction. They learn that Ukraine once had the power to destroy cities on another continent and gave it up in the name of peace.</p>\n\n<p>They also learn that power, once surrendered, is not returned when you need it most.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Ukraine should have kept its nuclear weapons. The question is whether great powers should make security guarantees they cannot or will not enforce. The question is whether assurances without accountability serve any purpose beyond postponing the inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine believed the promises of three nuclear powers. Russia broke its promise. The United States and Britain honored theirs only through diplomatic protest.</p>\n\n<p>The museum guide, Hennadiy Fil, now shows tourists how to simulate launching missiles that no longer exist. The button still works. The alarm still sounds. On screen, the world still ends.</p>\n\n<p>But the real missiles were destroyed in the 1990s, filled with concrete, turned into museum pieces. Ukraine trusted that it wouldn't need them.</p>\n\n<p>That trust is what the museum commemorates. Not just the weapons. The belief that written assurances from powerful nations meant something.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in the Pacific. I know what military exercises are. They are rehearsals.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing around Taiwan is not posturing. It is preparation.</p>\n\n<p>On December 29, the People's Liberation Army conducted joint drills encircling Taiwan—air, navy, rocket forces. Live fire scheduled. Five zones marked. Beijing called it a \"stern warning\" against separatism and external interference. Taiwan called it aggression. Both statements are true. Neither captures what is actually happening.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Taiwan's status. That question has been unresolved since 1949. This is about whether international order rests on law or on the willingness to enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>## What Changed</p>\n\n<p>Three things converged to trigger these drills: a $10 billion U.S. arms package to Taiwan, Japan's new prime minister stating Tokyo might intervene militarily if China moves on Taiwan, and the routine reality that Beijing sends warplanes and naval vessels toward the island nearly every day.</p>\n\n<p>That last point matters most.</p>\n\n<p>These exercises are no longer exceptional. They are regular. What was once crisis is now pattern. Beijing has normalized military pressure to the point where live-fire drills around a democratic nation of 23 million people barely register as news.</p>\n\n<p>The normalization of the extraordinary is how republics lose their way.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States is obligated to assist Taiwan's defense. That law emerged from a specific compromise: President Carter's administration recognized Beijing diplomatically while maintaining an informal commitment to Taiwan's security. For decades, this arrangement preserved an uneasy peace.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether that obligation retains meaning when the threat is constant rather than acute.</p>\n\n<p>When military exercises become daily background noise, when blockade rehearsals happen on a schedule, when \"precision strikes on key targets\" are announced in press releases, the nature of the threat has changed. It is no longer a crisis that might be deterred. It is a steady pressure designed to exhaust resistance before force is ever used.</p>\n\n<p>This matters constitutionally because it tests whether treaty obligations and statutory commitments can function when the adversary operates below the threshold that triggers response. Beijing is not invading Taiwan. It is surrounding it, drilling around it, flying over it, testing it. At what point does that pattern constitute the threat the Taiwan Relations Act was designed to address?</p>\n\n<p>Congress has not answered that question. It may not be answerable in advance. But the failure to ask it aloud means we are drifting toward a moment when the question will be answered by events rather than by deliberate choice.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>What is happening around Taiwan is being watched everywhere territorial disputes remain unresolved. The lesson being transmitted is this: if you have the patience and the military capacity to make the extraordinary routine, you can shift facts on the ground without firing a shot.</p>\n\n<p>This is not new in history. It is how empires have expanded for millennia. What is new is the precision with which it can be executed and the speed with which democratic publics become desensitized to it.</p>\n\n<p>When I was in uniform, we understood that readiness was not just about our own capability. It was about credibility. The adversary had to believe we would do what we said we would do. That belief was the deterrent. The moment that belief weakened, the deterrent collapsed, and the cost of restoring it became exponentially higher.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, credibility is being tested daily. Not through dramatic confrontation, but through incremental pressure that forces the question: at what point does the United States honor its commitment, and how will it know when that point has arrived?</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals About Power and Accountability</p>\n\n<p>The drills around Taiwan expose a deeper problem: the gap between stated policy and operational reality. Washington has committed to Taiwan's defense. But that commitment has never been defined with precision. It rests on strategic ambiguity, a doctrine that worked for decades but may no longer function when the threat is not a singular invasion but a slow encirclement.</p>\n\n<p>Strategic ambiguity requires restraint on all sides. It requires Beijing to refrain from forcing the issue and Washington to refrain from clarifying its response. But when one side stops exercising restraint, the ambiguity collapses. What remains is not strategy but drift.</p>\n\n<p>This is the accountability question: Who decides when the commitment is triggered? The President? Congress? A general in the field reading radar screens as Chinese aircraft approach Taiwan's air defense zone for the 300th time this year?</p>\n\n<p>If that decision is left undefined, it will be made in crisis, under pressure, with incomplete information. That is how wars begin that no one intended to fight.</p>\n\n<p>## The Historical Echo</p>\n\n<p>There is a parallel here to the 1930s, though not the one usually invoked. This is not about appeasement in the face of open aggression. This is about the slow accumulation of facts that make aggression seem inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Before 1939, there were remilitarizations, annexations, provocations. Each one tested whether the international order would respond. Each time the response was delayed or diluted, the next provocation became easier. The problem was not that democracies failed to recognize the threat. The problem was that they failed to recognize the cumulative weight of small violations.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that accumulation now. Not in Europe, but in the Pacific. Not with tanks rolling across borders, but with naval forces surrounding an island, air forces penetrating airspace, and rocket forces rehearsing strikes.</p>\n\n<p>The accumulation is the threat. The normalization is the danger.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>Here is the question that is not being asked: What is the constitutional process by which the United States would honor its commitment to Taiwan?</p>\n\n<p>Not the moral question. Not the strategic question. The constitutional question.</p>\n\n<p>If Beijing blockades Taiwan, does the President have authority to respond militarily without congressional authorization? If Congress has that authority, has it delegated it through the Taiwan Relations Act, or must it vote again? If a vote is required, how quickly can it happen when the window for effective response may be measured in hours?</p>\n\n<p>These are not abstract questions. They are the questions that determine whether our commitments are real or rhetorical.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that the power to make war had to be shared between Congress and the executive precisely because war was too consequential to be left to any single authority. But they also understood that speed sometimes mattered, which is why the President commands the armed forces once war is authorized.</p>\n\n<p>What they did not envision was a world where war could be waged incrementally, where the line between peace and conflict could be so blurred that no one could say with certainty when it had been crossed.</p>\n\n<p>That is the world we inhabit now. And our constitutional system has not adapted to it.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Means for Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy in a republic rests on consent. The people, through their representatives, decide when to go to war. That principle is foundational. It is why the Constitution gives Congress, not the President, the power to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>But if military conflict can begin without a declaration, if commitments can be triggered without a vote, if the executive can commit forces based on decades-old statutory language that was intentionally ambiguous, then the consent of the governed becomes theoretical rather than real.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an argument against defending Taiwan. It is an argument for clarity about how that defense would be authorized and by whom.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we have neither clarity nor public debate. We have policy by drift, strategy by assumption, and commitment by implication. That is not how a constitutional republic is supposed to function.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>These drills are a test. Not just of military capability, but of political will. Not just of Taiwan's resilience, but of America's seriousness.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether the United States should defend Taiwan. The question is whether we have defined what defense means, authorized the means to carry it out, and prepared the public for what it might require.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer to any of those questions is no, then the commitment is hollow. And hollow commitments do not deter adversaries. They invite miscalculation.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 41 that the powers of government must be adequate to the security of the nation. Adequate. Not excessive, but sufficient. Right now, the adequacy of our constitutional process to meet the threat being rehearsed around Taiwan is unproven.</p>\n\n<p>That is the meaning of these drills. They are not just a rehearsal for Beijing. They are a test of whether our system can respond coherently when the threat arrives not as Pearl Harbor but as a thousand small incursions that accumulate into encirclement.</p>\n\n<p>The test is here.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served under commanders who understood that security guarantees mean something specific. They are not aspirations. They are commitments backed by the full weight of American power, and they bind not just one administration but the Republic itself.</p>\n\n<p>That's why what happened at Mar-a-Lago matters.</p>\n\n<p>The President of the United States offered Ukraine a fifteen-year security guarantee. The President of Ukraine asked for fifty. Both men spoke as if these were terms in a real estate negotiation, numbers to be haggled over, percentages to be quoted to reporters.</p>\n\n<p>Neither man appears to have asked the question that the Constitution requires: By what authority?</p>\n\n<p>## What a Guarantee Means</p>\n\n<p>A security guarantee is not a policy preference. It is a commitment that American forces will respond to aggression against another nation. It is, in substance if not in form, a mutual defense treaty.</p>\n\n<p>The North Atlantic Treaty, ratified in 1949, commits the United States to consider an armed attack against any NATO member as an attack against all. That commitment was approved by the Senate with a vote of 82-13. It has shaped American foreign policy for seventy-five years. Soldiers have deployed under its authority. Some have died under its flag.</p>\n\n<p>That treaty did not emerge from a resort in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>It was debated in the Senate. Witnesses testified. Amendments were proposed. The American people, through their elected representatives, decided whether this commitment was compatible with their security and their constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>The process was public. The vote was recorded. The obligation was clear.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We Are Watching</p>\n\n<p>What is being proposed now follows a different pattern.</p>\n\n<p>An executive commitment, negotiated privately, announced through press conferences, binding future administrations to obligations they did not approve and may not support. The Senate is not consulted. Treaties are not signed. Yet American credibility, and potentially American lives, are pledged.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time. It is the continuation of a shift that began decades ago.</p>\n\n<p>In 1973, President Nixon promised South Vietnam continued military support. Congress cut funding two years later. Saigon fell.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, the United States helped overthrow Libya's government without Congressional authorization, invoking an expansive interpretation of existing UN resolutions. The country remains fractured.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, President Obama declared that chemical weapons use in Syria would cross a \"red line.\" The line was crossed. No response followed. The commitment evaporated.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, the mechanism was the same: executive pronouncements treated as binding commitments, then abandoned or ignored when circumstances changed or political will shifted.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether any particular president is trustworthy. The question is whether commitments made without constitutional process are commitments at all.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Understood</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution vests the power to declare war in Congress. It requires Senate approval for treaties by a two-thirds vote. These are not procedural formalities. They are structural protections against executive overreach.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that the power to commit the nation to war must be separated from the power to wage it. Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the president's authority as commander-in-chief \"would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces.\" The decision to deploy those forces in a binding commitment of collective defense was reserved to the legislative branch.</p>\n\n<p>This separation was not an accident. It was the lesson of history.</p>\n\n<p>Kings made alliances. Kings pledged support. Kings sent armies to honor commitments that subjects had not approved and could not escape. The Constitution was written to ensure that the American people, through their representatives, would decide which wars to fight and which commitments to honor.</p>\n\n<p>What we are watching is the quiet erosion of that principle.</p>\n\n<p>## The Mechanism of Evasion</p>\n\n<p>The word \"guarantee\" is being used carefully. It is not \"treaty.\" It is not \"alliance.\" It is not \"mutual defense.\" Those words trigger constitutional requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Instead we hear: partnership, framework, assurance, commitment. The language is deliberately vague. It suggests obligation without invoking process. It allows presidents to claim they have secured peace while avoiding the Senate vote that would test whether the commitment is real.</p>\n\n<p>This is not unique to Ukraine. It is the pattern of modern executive power.</p>\n\n<p>The Authorization for Use of Military Force, passed in 2001 to pursue those responsible for the September 11 attacks, has been used to justify military operations in at least nineteen countries. Presidents of both parties have invoked it. No new authorization has been sought. The war powers have effectively been transferred to the executive, constrained only by the willingness of Congress to defund operations after they begin.</p>\n\n<p>Security guarantees without Senate approval follow the same logic. They create facts on the ground. They generate expectations. They make it politically costly to reverse course. By the time Congress might object, the commitment is already operational.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how the Constitution distributes the war power.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Ukraine deserves support. The question is not whether peace in Europe serves American interests. Those are legitimate policy debates.</p>\n\n<p>The question is this: Can a president, acting alone, commit the United States to the defense of another nation?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then the treaty power is meaningless. If fifteen-year guarantees can be negotiated at Mar-a-Lago, then Senate ratification is a formality we have outgrown. If the credibility of the United States can be pledged in a press conference, then the constitutional process for making binding commitments is an anachronism.</p>\n\n<p>That answer would represent a fundamental change in our constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>It would mean that the decision to go to war, or to create conditions that make war likely, rests solely with whoever holds the executive office. It would mean that the check the Founders built into the system—the requirement that the people's representatives approve commitments that might cost American lives—has been bypassed.</p>\n\n<p>It would mean that the presidency has become what the Founders feared: a temporary kingship, constrained by elections but not by law.</p>\n\n<p>## What History Teaches</p>\n\n<p>Security guarantees made without constitutional process do not last. They collapse the moment political circumstances change. The commitments evaporate. The credibility is spent.</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum of 1994 offered security assurances to Ukraine in exchange for surrendering its nuclear weapons. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia signed. Twenty years later, Russia invaded. The assurances proved empty.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between that memorandum and a Senate-ratified treaty is not rhetorical. It is constitutional. Treaties bind. Assurances do not. The distinction is not legalistic hairsplitting. It is the difference between a commitment enforceable under American law and a promise that evaporates when convenient.</p>\n\n<p>If we are serious about supporting Ukraine, the path is clear: negotiate a treaty, present it to the Senate, let the American people decide through their representatives whether this commitment is one they are willing to honor. If two-thirds of the Senate agrees, the commitment is real. If not, then we know the answer.</p>\n\n<p>What we are watching instead is the simulation of commitment without its substance.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath did not include a carve-out for foreign policy. It did not exempt security guarantees. It did not allow me to decide which parts of the constitutional order were binding and which were obsolete.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether that oath still governs.</p>\n\n<p>If presidents can commit the nation to war without Senate approval, if security guarantees can be negotiated in private and announced as fait accompli, if the treaty power can be bypassed through creative language and executive determination, then the constitutional structure is no longer operative. It has been replaced by something else: a system where power is checked only by the next election, not by law.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the system the Founders designed.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers being discussed—fifteen years, fifty years—are less important than the process being avoided. The percentages quoted—ninety percent, ninety-five percent—are less significant than the vote not being taken.</p>\n\n<p>The Senate exists for moments like this. The treaty power exists to ensure that commitments of American blood and treasure are made deliberately, publicly, and with the consent of the governed. If that process can be circumvented whenever a president decides it is inconvenient, then it is not a constitutional requirement. It is a suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>And suggestions do not bind.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength. But strength without legitimacy is only power. And power without process is what we fought a revolution to escape.</p>",

      "headline": "When Covert Becomes Overt: The CIA Strike in Venezuela and the Erosion of Restraint",
      "content": "<p>The CIA conducted a drone strike on Venezuelan soil last week. The President of the United States publicly acknowledged it. The agency declined to comment. Congress was presumably notified under covert action statutes, but the American people learned about it from the president's own words to a radio host.</p>\n\n<p>That sequence should trouble you.</p>\n\n<p>Not because of what happened in Venezuela. Not because of policy toward Maduro's narco-state. But because of what it reveals about how war powers now operate in this country.</p>\n\n<p>I served long enough to know that intelligence operations require secrecy. Covert action exists for good reason: some threats cannot be addressed through diplomacy or open military force. The National Security Act of 1947 established the CIA precisely because some missions require deniability. Congress codified oversight mechanisms after the Church Committee because covert action, by its nature, carries extraordinary risks.</p>\n\n<p>But something has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>The President is using the CIA to conduct what are effectively military strikes, then discussing them in media appearances. He confirmed in October that he had authorized CIA covert operations in Venezuela. Then he referenced specific strikes. Then he declined to specify whether the latest operation was CIA or military, while officials confirmed to reporters that it was indeed the agency.</p>\n\n<p>This is not covert action as the framework contemplates it. This is the use of intelligence authorities to accomplish military objectives while avoiding the restraints that apply to military operations.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Restraint</p>\n\n<p>When the military conducts strikes on foreign soil, certain mechanisms engage. The War Powers Resolution requires notification to Congress within 48 hours. The Authorization for Use of Military Force, however interpreted or abused, must be invoked. Military lawyers apply the law of armed conflict. Records are created. Chain of command is clear. Years later, historians can trace decisions.</p>\n\n<p>When the CIA acts covertly, different rules apply. The President must issue a formal \"finding\" under 50 U.S.C. § 3093. The Gang of Eight, leaders of the intelligence committees, must be notified. But the operations themselves remain classified. No public record exists. No debate occurs. The American people learn only what the administration chooses to disclose, if anything.</p>\n\n<p>The system assumes these will be different kinds of operations.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when they become the same operation, conducted under different authorities?</p>\n\n<p>That is not a hypothetical question. That is what we are watching.</p>\n\n<p>## The Venezuelan Escalation</p>\n\n<p>The administration has been conducting a months-long pressure campaign against Venezuela. It began with a Caribbean buildup in August. Thirty military strikes on alleged drug boats followed. Then came tanker seizures. Now, a strike on Venezuelan land, the first since this campaign began.</p>\n\n<p>Each step moves the line. Each step establishes a new baseline of normal. And by routing this latest strike through the CIA rather than Special Operations Command, the administration avoids certain reporting requirements that would apply to military action while still discussing the operation publicly enough to send a message.</p>\n\n<p>That message is heard in Caracas. But it should also be heard in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Maduro runs a criminal regime. He does. The question is not whether Venezuela poses challenges for U.S. interests. It does. The question is whether the President may conduct what amounts to a sustained military campaign using intelligence authorities to sidestep the mechanisms that Congress established to constrain executive war powers.</p>\n\n<p>I know what the answer is supposed to be. I am watching something different happen.</p>\n\n<p>## What Gets Normalized</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, Congress passed an AUMF targeting those responsible for 9/11. Three presidential administrations stretched that authorization to cover groups that did not exist in 2001, in countries Congress never mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>That expansion happened gradually. Each strike was justified by the one before. Each target was described as sufficiently connected to the original authorization. And over time, what was meant to be a specific response to a specific attack became a general grant of authority to strike threats wherever the executive identified them.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching a similar process with covert action authorities. What was meant for operations requiring deniability is being used for operations the President discusses on talk radio. What was meant for intelligence collection and limited paramilitary action is being used for sustained military campaigns. And what was meant to be subject to specific oversight is being routed through mechanisms that allow less scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>The CIA is not supposed to be a parallel military for hire. The intelligence committees are not supposed to substitute for the Armed Services Committees' oversight of military operations. And the President is not supposed to be able to wage war by choosing which statutory framework creates the least friction.</p>\n\n<p>But if you can achieve the same objective through intelligence authorities that you could through military action, and intelligence authorities require less notification, less documentation, and less public scrutiny, why would any president choose the more constrained path?</p>\n\n<p>The incentive structure now favors using covert action authorities for overt purposes.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question Congress Is Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>Congressional leaders were presumably briefed on this operation. The Gang of Eight was notified as required by law. But the rest of Congress, and the American people, know only what was publicly disclosed.</p>\n\n<p>That is the system working as designed for genuine covert action.</p>\n\n<p>It is not the system working as designed for sustained military pressure campaigns that the President discusses in media appearances.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what Congress should be asking: If the President is comfortable enough with an operation to reference it publicly, should that operation be conducted under authorities designed for actions that must remain secret?</p>\n\n<p>The covert action statute does not prohibit the President from later acknowledging operations. But it assumes that operations will generally remain classified, and that public acknowledgment will be the exception, not the pattern. It assumes that intelligence operations will be intelligence operations, not substitutes for military campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>When those assumptions break down, the statutory framework stops functioning as intended. The restraints Congress imposed become suggestions. And the difference between war powers subject to legislative oversight and executive action requiring only notification to eight members begins to collapse.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent</p>\n\n<p>This matters beyond Venezuela. It matters beyond this administration. Because what is established here will be available to every future president.</p>\n\n<p>If intelligence authorities can be used for sustained campaigns against nation-states, then the next president facing a crisis will remember that option. If operations can be discussed publicly while still remaining formally covert, then the distinction between acknowledged military action and deniable intelligence operations loses meaning. And if Congress accepts this expansion without clarifying the limits, then those limits effectively no longer exist.</p>\n\n<p>The tools we create for extraordinary circumstances become the tools we use for ordinary ones. The authorities we grant for this threat become the authorities invoked for the next. And the restraints we erode today are the restraints our children will wish existed when they inherit these powers in different hands.</p>\n\n<p>I have watched this process before. After 9/11, after the AUMF expansion, after drones became routine in Pakistan and Yemen and Somalia. Each time, the argument was that circumstances required flexibility. Each time, the promise was that authorities would be used responsibly. Each time, the expectation was that restraint would persist through norms if not through law.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, the restraints eroded anyway.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Constitution Anticipated</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the power to declare war. Article II makes the President Commander in Chief. The Founders created tension between those powers deliberately, believing that the decision to use force should require both branches to act.</p>\n\n<p>The intelligence apparatus was created later, after World War II, when the nature of conflict changed and new threats required new tools. But the fundamental structure remained: the decision to commit the nation to sustained military action should not rest with one person.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is the development of a workaround. If military action requires too much congressional involvement, use intelligence authorities instead. If the War Powers Resolution constrains one path, take another. If oversight is friction, choose the framework that generates less.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution's architecture of restraint only works if we maintain the distinction between different kinds of power. When those distinctions blur, when authorities meant for one purpose are used for another, the restraints fail.</p>\n\n<p>Not through defiance. Through adaptation.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Demand</p>\n\n<p>You do not need to oppose operations against drug traffickers to ask whether the legal framework governing those operations remains sound. You do not need to defend Maduro to ask whether the President should be able to wage undeclared war using intelligence authorities. You do not need to be a pacifist to believe that the decision to use force on foreign soil should be subject to meaningful democratic oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Those questions are not partisan. They are constitutional.</p>\n\n<p>If Congress believes the Venezuela campaign is justified, it should authorize it through military authorities. If the campaign requires secrecy, it should remain covert and unacknowledged. But the current approach, publicly discussed operations conducted through secret authorities, serves no legitimate purpose except to avoid the oversight mechanisms that would otherwise apply.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a constitutional republic should function. That is how restraints disappear while everyone is watching but no one is objecting.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether you support this operation. The test is whether you believe the next president, the one whose judgment you do not trust, should inherit these authorities in this form.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then the time to clarify the limits is now. Before the practice becomes precedent. Before the exception becomes the rule. Before temporary flexibility becomes permanent power.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders did not trust any individual with unconstrained war powers. They built a system that required Congress and the Executive to both participate in decisions to use force.

      "content": "<p>I spent years handling classified material. Not as a policy matter or a legal theory, but as someone who carried documents in locked cases, who understood that certain information, once disclosed, could cost lives. I learned that accountability isn't abstract. It's the difference between order and chaos, between a system that constrains power and one that merely justifies it.</p>\n\n<p>Jack Smith sat before the House Judiciary Committee on December 17th and made a statement that should be unremarkable but has become extraordinary: \"The Jan. 6 riot does not happen without Donald Trump.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not a political claim. This is prosecutorial judgment, offered under oath, about causation and culpability.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this moment significant is not what Smith said, but what happened next. The cases were abandoned. Not because the evidence failed. Not because a jury acquitted. Because the subject of the investigation won an election, and Justice Department policy prohibits indicting a sitting president.</p>\n\n<p>That policy is defensible. What is less defensible is what it reveals about how we now understand accountability.</p>\n\n<p>## The Prosecutor Who Could Not Prosecute</p>\n\n<p>Smith laid out his evidence in the deposition. He described Trump as \"the most culpable and most responsible person\" in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. He detailed how the case was built on testimony from Republicans who chose country over party, including a Pennsylvania elector who called the scheme \"an attempt to overthrow the government and illegal.\" He noted that Trump \"caused\" the Capitol attack, \"exploited it,\" and that it was \"foreseeable to him.\"</p>\n\n<p>He also described what Trump did while the violence unfolded: refused to stop it, issued a tweet that \"without question in my mind endangered the life of his own vice president,\" and had to be \"pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not hearsay. This is the assessment of a veteran prosecutor who reviewed the evidence, obtained cooperating witnesses, and presented the case to a grand jury that returned an indictment.</p>\n\n<p>Then Trump won the election. The cases ended.</p>\n\n<p>Not because the facts changed. Because the defendant's status changed.</p>\n\n<p>## What Has Quietly Shifted</p>\n\n<p>The principle that a sitting president cannot be indicted is longstanding. It rests on the idea that prosecuting a president while in office would interfere with the executive function. The remedy for presidential misconduct, in this framework, is impeachment, not indictment.</p>\n\n<p>But impeachment requires political will. It requires a Congress willing to place constitutional duty above partisan loyalty. What happens when that will does not exist? What happens when impeachment becomes a partisan exercise, acquittal a foregone conclusion, and the only remaining check is criminal prosecution after leaving office?</p>\n\n<p>What happens when a person can avoid that prosecution by winning another election?</p>\n\n<p>We are watching the collapse of the distinction between legal immunity and practical impunity.</p>\n\n<p>Legal immunity is temporary and bounded. It says: while you hold this office, you cannot be indicted, but you remain accountable through impeachment, and you remain subject to prosecution once you leave.</p>\n\n<p>Practical impunity is different. It says: if you can stay in power long enough, or regain power quickly enough, the law cannot reach you. The clock runs out. The cases are dismissed. The evidence is preserved in a transcript that becomes a historical footnote, not a judicial verdict.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Are Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>Smith was asked during his deposition whether his investigations were meant to prevent Trump from reclaiming the presidency. He bristled at the question, and rightly so. Prosecutors investigate crimes. Grand juries return indictments when they find probable cause. The timing of an investigation does not negate the validity of the charges.</p>\n\n<p>But here is the question we should be asking: What does it mean for the rule of law when the most serious charges against a former president can be nullified not by exoneration, but by election?</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Trump. This is about precedent.</p>\n\n<p>If a president can commit acts that a special counsel describes as criminal, if those acts can be detailed in an indictment, if cooperating witnesses can be found, if a grand jury can return charges, and if all of that can be rendered moot by winning another election, then we have created a new constitutional reality.</p>\n\n<p>We have created a category of person who is, in effect, above the law not because the law exempts them, but because the mechanisms of accountability have become too slow, too political, too easily gamed.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Feared</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 that impeachment was the remedy for \"offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\" He understood that such offenses were \"political\" in nature, meaning they related to the conduct of the state and the duties of office.</p>\n\n<p>But Hamilton also understood the danger of leaving such matters entirely to political bodies. He knew that \"the division of the government into distinct and separate departments\" was meant to prevent the concentration of power, and that each branch was meant to check the others.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when one branch will not check, and another cannot prosecute?</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist No. 51 that \"ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\" The system depends on each branch defending its prerogatives, on institutional jealousy preventing the accumulation of unchecked power.</p>\n\n<p>But what happens when ambition does not counteract ambition? What happens when one party controls both the executive and the legislative branch, and regards accountability as disloyalty?</p>\n\n<p>The system bends. The lines move. What was once extraordinary becomes routine.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing that Trump should have been convicted. I am not arguing that the evidence was dispositive, or that a jury would have reached a particular verdict. Those are questions for a courtroom, and we will never know the answers because the cases did not proceed.</p>\n\n<p>What I am arguing is this: We are normalizing a system in which the most serious allegations against a president can be investigated, indicted, and then abandoned not because they were disproven, but because the calendar ran out.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the rule of law. That is the rule of timing.</p>\n\n<p>Smith's testimony will be read by historians. It will be cited in law review articles. It may even be taught in classrooms as an example of prosecutorial judgment in politically charged cases. But it will not result in a verdict, because the defendant became unreachable.</p>\n\n<p>Is this compatible with a free society? Is this what the Founders intended when they created a system of checks and balances?</p>\n\n<p>Those questions, unanswered, define the test we face. Not whether Trump is guilty or innocent, but whether the system can hold anyone accountable when accountability depends on speed, on political will, and on an electorate that may or may not care.</p>\n\n<p>That test is here.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Taiwan's president stood before cameras after China's latest military drills and pledged to defend the island's sovereignty. The statement was expected. The drills were expected. The international response was expected.</p>\n\n<p>That's the problem.</p>\n\n<p>We have normalized what should be extraordinary. Large-scale military exercises encircling a democratic society of 23 million people have become routine enough that they merit brief news coverage before we move to the next story. The question isn't whether Taiwan's president will defend sovereignty. The question is whether the international order still recognizes sovereignty as something more than a performance.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in government watching how power moves when no one is watching the seams. You learn that the most dangerous shifts aren't sudden. They're incremental. They're the drills that happen every few months until they're happening every few weeks. They're the intrusions that cross a line until that line becomes the new baseline.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Taiwan alone. This is about whether territorial integrity means anything when backed only by statements rather than structure.</p>\n\n<p>**The Erosion We're Witnessing**</p>\n\n<p>The drills China conducts around Taiwan follow a pattern anyone who has studied military operations recognizes: normalization through repetition. Each exercise pushes slightly further. Each one lasts slightly longer. Each one involves slightly more sophisticated capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The goal isn't invasion today. The goal is making the possibility of invasion so routine that when it happens, the world responds with the same measured statements it's been issuing for years.</p>\n\n<p>This is how lines move. Not through dramatic declarations but through patient pressure.</p>\n\n<p>The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 commits the United States to provide Taiwan with defense articles and services. It states that any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than peaceful means would be \"of grave concern.\" But grave concern has become the international community's standard response to nearly everything. The phrase has been depleted of meaning through overuse.</p>\n\n<p>What we're watching is the slow strangulation of a principle—that borders cannot be changed by force—through the patient application of force that stops just short of war.</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Guarantees**</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan operates under strategic ambiguity. The United States has not explicitly guaranteed its defense. This ambiguity was meant to deter both Chinese aggression and Taiwanese declarations of formal independence. It was meant to preserve stability.</p>\n\n<p>But ambiguity only works when all parties believe certain lines still matter. When those lines are tested repeatedly without consequence, ambiguity becomes indistinguishability. It becomes unclear whether commitments exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>I've sat in rooms where officials debate what level of action would trigger response. The debates are earnest. The analysis is sophisticated. But the underlying question is never quite asked: At what point does our failure to enforce principles mean we no longer hold those principles?</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that power respects nothing but power. Hamilton wrote in Federalist 34 that nations must have \"an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they might arise.\" But he was writing about a nation's capacity to defend itself, not the international community's capacity to defend abstract principles while avoiding risk.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan can pledge to defend its sovereignty. That pledge means nothing without the capacity to make good on it, and small democracies facing large authoritarian neighbors rarely possess that capacity alone.</p>\n\n<p>**What Sovereignty Means**</p>\n\n<p>Sovereignty isn't a statement. It's a fact pattern. It's functioning institutions, territorial control, international recognition, and the capacity to defend all three. Taiwan has the first three. The fourth is what's being tested.</p>\n\n<p>The People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan. Not for a day. Taiwan has its own constitution, its own military, its own currency, its own democratically elected government. By any functional measure, Taiwan is sovereign.</p>\n\n<p>But sovereignty without security is sovereignty on loan. It lasts until someone stronger decides it shouldn't.</p>\n\n<p>This is the test we're failing to acknowledge. The question isn't whether Taiwan will defend itself. The question is whether the international order still believes that territorial integrity matters enough to impose costs on those who violate it before the violation is complete.</p>\n\n<p>**The Pattern We've Seen Before**</p>\n\n<p>Crimea was sovereign Ukrainian territory until Russian troops arrived and it wasn't. The international community condemned the action, imposed sanctions, and moved on. Crimea is still occupied.</p>\n\n<p>Georgia's breakaway regions were sovereign Georgian territory until Russian recognition and military support made them independent in everything but international law. The world objected. The regions remain separated.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is consistent: Test boundaries, face condemnation, absorb sanctions, retain gains. The cost-benefit analysis favors aggression when the costs are temporary and the benefits are permanent.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan sees this. That's why its president must pledge to defend sovereignty rather than assume it. That's why the island spends over two percent of GDP on defense despite having an economy built on trade and technology, not military power. That's why every military drill from Beijing sends not just a message but a measurement: How much will they prepare? How much will their partners commit?</p>\n\n<p>**The American Question**</p>\n\n<p>The United States faces a version of the question the Founders debated: How do you preserve liberty against power without becoming the thing you oppose? How do you maintain order without maintaining empire?</p>\n\n<p>We have interests in Taiwan's continued autonomy. Economic interests—the island produces the advanced semiconductors that run modern economies. Strategic interests—Taiwan sits at a geographic chokepoint for Pacific trade. Moral interests—23 million people living in a democracy should not be absorbed into an authoritarian state against their will.</p>\n\n<p>But interests are not commitments, and in the ambiguity between the two, Taiwan lives in permanent uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know whether the United States should explicitly guarantee Taiwan's defense. That decision involves calculations above my rank. But I know what happens when commitments are ambiguous and adversaries are patient. I know what happens when we treat sovereignty as a principle we honor in rhetoric but not in risk.</p>\n\n<p>We get more drills. More intrusions. More normalization of what should be extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Until one day it isn't a drill.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question we're not asking is this: What makes sovereignty real?</p>\n\n<p>Is it international recognition? Taiwan doesn't have that—most nations maintain only informal ties to avoid angering Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>Is it functional independence? Taiwan has that, but function without security is temporary.</p>\n\n<p>Is it the will to defend? Taiwan has that too, but will without capacity is performance.</p>\n\n<p>Is it external guarantees? Taiwan has strategic ambiguity, which might mean support or might mean statements.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is probably all of the above, functioning together. Remove any piece and the structure weakens. Remove enough pieces and sovereignty becomes something leaders pledge to defend because it can no longer be assumed.</p>\n\n<p>That's where Taiwan is. That's where we've let it arrive through incremental acceptance of what should be unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>When military drills encircling a democracy become routine. When we measure our response in careful statements rather than committed action. When sovereignty requires daily defense rather than assumed respect.</p>\n\n<p>We're not just failing Taiwan. We're failing the principle that borders exist, that territorial integrity matters, that might doesn't make right when right has no might behind it.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't in Taiwan's pledge to defend its sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>The test is whether the rest of us still believe sovereignty means anything worth defending.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in places where coalitions held together not from shared principles but from shared enemies. When the enemy recedes, the coalition's real nature becomes visible. What happens next tests whether the arrangement was ever about governance or merely about power.</p>\n\n<p>Yemen is teaching that lesson again.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We've Seen Before</p>\n\n<p>The Southern Transitional Council announced a constitution for an independent South Yemen on January 2, 2026. That's not a declaration of independence in the way Americans understand the term—not a statement of grievances followed by an assertion of natural rights. It's a unilateral claim to authority backed by force, announced while Saudi warplanes strike STC positions and UAE support flows to the separatists.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't governance. This is partition by violence under the rhetoric of self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>The international community has spent a decade pretending the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen was unified in purpose: restore the internationally recognized government, defeat the Iranian-backed Houthis, stabilize the country. That coalition is now bombing itself. Saudi Arabia strikes UAE-backed forces. The government it claimed to restore has fled to Riyadh. The Presidential Palace in Aden, which coalition forces supposedly secured, is controlled by separatists who reject that government's authority entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The pretense has collapsed.</p>\n\n<p>## What a Constitution Actually Requires</p>\n\n<p>The STC calls its document a \"constitution.\" It has 30 articles. It proclaims \"the State of South Arabia.\" It promises a referendum in two years on self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>But a constitution is not merely a document asserting authority. It is a framework that derives legitimacy from the consent of the governed, implemented through processes that create accountability rather than merely consolidating control.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison, in Federalist 51, wrote that \"the structure of the government must furnish the proper checks and balances between the different departments.\" The STC's \"constitution\" appears to furnish nothing but an assertion of territorial control by forces that seized two provinces by arms last month and now demand other factions accept their claim.</p>\n\n<p>That's not constitutionalism. That's conquest with paperwork.</p>\n\n<p>The test of a constitutional order is whether it constrains power or merely justifies it. Whether it creates mechanisms for peaceful resolution of disputes or demands submission under threat of force. Whether temporary authority remains temporary or becomes permanent through the logic of emergency.</p>\n\n<p>The STC's \"constitution\" appears designed to do the opposite: to present a unilateral seizure of territory as a legitimate constitutional act, to frame military control as self-determination, to make provisional what should require deliberation and consent.</p>\n\n<p>## When Imposed Order Reveals Its Nature</p>\n\n<p>For ten years, the international community treated the Saudi-led coalition as a legitimate governing authority in Yemen. The United States provided intelligence, refueling, targeting assistance. The coalition's intervention was framed as restoring order, protecting regional stability, countering Iranian expansion.</p>\n\n<p>That intervention has killed tens of thousands of civilians. It has produced what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. It has destroyed infrastructure, blockaded ports, and created conditions for famine and disease. And now the coalition that justified all of this as necessary for Yemen's stability is fracturing into open conflict between its major backers.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an aberration. This is the nature of imposed order revealing itself when the justifying emergency no longer holds the arrangement together.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia now bombs positions it once funded. The UAE supports forces that reject the government it once claimed to restore. Forces that fought together against the Houthis now fight each other for control of the south. The internationally recognized government exists in exile, recognized internationally but governing nothing.</p>\n\n<p>And through it all, the Houthis still control the north.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson isn't that intervention always fails. The lesson is that intervention justified by temporary emergency tends to become permanent, that coalitions built on shared enemies rather than shared principles fracture when the enemy recedes, and that the pretense of legitimacy eventually collapses under the weight of what was done in its name.</p>\n\n<p>## The Questions Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>When a faction announces a constitution while under bombardment by its former allies, several questions become relevant:</p>\n\n<p>Was the coalition ever about the principles it claimed, or was it always about competing regional powers using Yemen as a proxy battlefield?</p>\n\n<p>If the internationally recognized government was the coalition's goal, why does that government now exist only in exile while coalition members fight each other for control?</p>\n\n<p>If stability was the objective, what has been achieved after ten years of intervention except the fragmentation of the country into competing spheres of influence, each backed by a different external power?</p>\n\n<p>If humanitarian protection justified the intervention, how do we account for the humanitarian catastrophe the intervention produced?</p>\n\n<p>And most importantly: when does temporary authority imposed by emergency become indistinguishable from permanent rule justified by necessity?</p>\n\n<p>These questions matter beyond Yemen. They matter every time intervention is justified by temporary emergency, every time coalition unity is asserted without examining what holds it together, every time constitutional language is deployed to legitimize what force has already decided.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals About Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>The STC's \"constitution\" will likely be dismissed by the international community as illegitimate because it was announced unilaterally, without consultation, backed by force rather than consent. That dismissal will be correct.</p>\n\n<p>But the same standard should apply to the arrangement that preceded it: a coalition justified by restoring a government that never controlled the territory it claimed, backed by powers whose actual interests diverged from their stated principles, maintained through a decade of violence that achieved none of its stated objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy cannot be asserted by proclamation, whether that proclamation comes from separatists announcing a constitution or from coalitions announcing their mission is stability while bombing hospitals.</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy requires consent, accountability, mechanisms for peaceful change, and limits on power that bind those who wield it. The STC's document appears to provide none of those. Neither did the arrangement it seeks to replace.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a justification for the STC's actions. It's an observation about what happens when temporary authority imposed by force becomes the normal condition, when constitutional language is used to justify what violence has decided, when the test of legitimacy becomes which faction the international community chooses to recognize rather than whether any party has demonstrated accountability to the people they claim to govern.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test That Remains</p>\n\n<p>Yemen's fracture is not unique. It follows a pattern visible in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan—places where intervention was justified by temporary emergency, where imposed order was presented as necessary for stability, where coalitions held together through shared enemies rather than shared principles.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, the pretense eventually collapsed. The emergency never ended. The temporary authority became permanent. The coalition fractured. And the people who lived there paid the price for arrangements made in their name by powers whose interests lay elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't whether to intervene. The test is whether intervention creates or merely displaces violence, whether temporary authority remains temporary or becomes permanent, whether constitutional forms constrain power or merely justify it.</p>\n\n<p>Yemen is failing that test. Again.</p>\n\n<p>The question American citizens should ask is not which faction to support in Yemen's civil war. The question is whether the pattern that produced this outcome—intervention justified by temporary emergency, coalition unity asserted without examining what sustains it, constitutional language deployed to legitimize what force decides—is compatible with the principles we claim to hold.</p>\n\n<p>Not just in Yemen.</p>\n\n<p>Everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered honestly, is why this still matters.</p>",
