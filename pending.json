      "content": "<p>The United States government is pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela. This action follows the seizure of two previous vessels carrying Venezuelan crude.</p>\n\n<p>No formal declaration of war exists. No letter of marque has been issued by Congress. No blockade has been proclaimed through diplomatic channels to neutral nations.</p>\n\n<p>Yet ships are being stopped on the high seas.</p>\n\n<p>I say this as someone who wore the uniform. The seizure of merchant vessels in international waters is an act that, throughout history, has preceded or constituted war. The British seizure of American sailors and cargo was among the causes that led to the War of 1812. Confederate commerce raiders targeting Union shipping were instruments of declared hostilities. When Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, it understood it was choosing war.</p>\n\n<p>These were not police actions. They were acts of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Sanctions Authority</p>\n\n<p>The current seizures operate under the authority of economic sanctions, primarily those imposed through executive orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. These sanctions prohibit transactions with certain Venezuelan entities and individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is straightforward: When did the interdiction of neutral shipping on the high seas become an administrative matter?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions have existed for decades. But the scope of what now happens under sanctions authorities would be unrecognizable to earlier generations. We have moved from prohibiting American companies from doing business with sanctioned entities to actively seizing vessels, often flagged to third countries, carrying goods between non-American parties.</p>\n\n<p>This expansion happened gradually. Each step was justified as necessary, proportionate, targeted. Each seizure was framed as enforcement, not escalation.</p>\n\n<p>But when enforcement requires stopping ships at sea, the question is no longer about financial compliance. It is about the projection of force beyond our borders and outside the framework that the Constitution establishes for such projections.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Understood</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power \"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\"</p>\n\n<p>Letters of marque and reprisal were the mechanism by which Congress authorized private vessels to seize enemy shipping. The Founders included this specific power because they understood that taking ships at sea was an act of such gravity it required legislative authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the President's authority as commander in chief \"would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces... while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies, all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature.\"</p>\n\n<p>The distinction was deliberate. The power to take ships, like the power to declare war, was too consequential to rest with one person.</p>\n\n<p>## The Quiet Expansion</p>\n\n<p>I served in government during a period when these authorities were expanding. The justification was always the same: We face threats that require flexibility. Traditional mechanisms are too slow. The Constitution contemplates executive action in emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>All of this contains truth. But it elides a more fundamental question.</p>\n\n<p>If the authority being exercised requires ships to be stopped, boarded, and seized, has it not crossed the threshold that the Constitution places under legislative control?</p>\n\n<p>The ships being pursued are not American-flagged. The oil being carried is not American property. The transactions being interdicted are between third parties. The legal theory is that because these transactions ultimately violate U.S. sanctions, any ship anywhere can be subject to American jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>This is not enforcement of American law within American territory. This is the assertion that American law applies extraterritorially to anyone, anywhere, whose actions we deem to violate our economic prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what we would say if another nation asserted the same authority.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela is not popular. Its government's human rights record is poor. Its economic policies have been disastrous. These facts are not in dispute.</p>\n\n<p>But constitutional principles do not depend on whether the target is sympathetic.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the United States government has the authority, through executive action alone, to interdict merchant shipping on the high seas outside any declared state of hostilities.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we have redefined what \"war powers\" means. We have decided that the seizure of vessels, historically an act of war, is now simply an administrative tool of foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then what is happening requires congressional authorization that does not currently exist.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question being avoided is this: What limits remain on executive power if the interdiction of international commerce can be conducted indefinitely, without legislative authorization, under the banner of sanctions enforcement?</p>\n\n<p>Sanctions can be imposed by executive order. They can be maintained indefinitely. They can expand in scope from prohibiting American transactions to seizing third-party vessels. They require no declaration, no sunset provision, no periodic reauthorization.</p>\n\n<p>Compare this to the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces and limits such commitments to 60 days without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>The seizure of merchant vessels falls outside this framework entirely. It is treated as economic policy, not military action.</p>\n\n<p>Yet it requires warships. It involves the use of force. It is, in every practical sense, an act of war.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>I do not argue that sanctions are unconstitutional. I do not argue that the executive branch lacks any role in foreign affairs. I do not argue that Venezuela's government deserves support.</p>\n\n<p>I argue that the Constitution draws lines, and those lines matter.</p>\n\n<p>The power to seize ships was placed under legislative control because the Founders understood it as an act of war. That understanding has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to rename such acts so they fall outside constitutional constraints.</p>\n\n<p>When temporary measures become permanent, when extraordinary actions become routine, when the vocabulary changes but the substance remains, we are not adapting the Constitution to modern needs.</p>\n\n<p>We are evading it.</p>\n\n<p>The third tanker being pursued is not the story. The story is that we have accepted as normal what previous generations would have recognized as war, and we have done so without asking whether the constitutional architecture for such decisions still applies.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unasked, is why this matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to understand how things work when authorities want something done quickly. There are protocols. There are reviews. There are chains of command designed to ensure that even in moments of urgency, we remain a nation of laws.</p>\n\n<p>On March 15, 2025, those protocols failed.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act that evening to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order the same evening, halting the deportations until the men could have their day in court.</p>\n\n<p>The planes landed in El Salvador anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Let that fact settle. A federal judge issued an order. The executive branch ignored it. The government's defense was not that the order came too late, or that communications failed, or that some emergency made compliance impossible. The Justice Department argued that the judge had no authority to issue the order in the first place—that questions of foreign policy placed these deportations beyond judicial review.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a claim about timing. That is a claim about power.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Judge Found</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Judge Boasberg ruled that the United States government denied due process to 137 Venezuelan men it deported under the Alien Enemies Act. His opinion is careful, measured, grounded in constitutional requirement rather than political preference. The men, he found, deserved the chance to prove they were not gang members before being sent to a foreign prison. The government provided no such opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The administration will appeal. That is its right.</p>\n\n<p>But the opinion raises a question that transcends this particular case: If expedited removal allows the government to \"secretly spirit\" people to foreign custody before a court can intervene, what remains of judicial review?</p>\n\n<p>The answer the Justice Department offered in March was: nothing. When the executive acts in matters touching foreign relations, it suggested, courts should stay out.</p>\n\n<p>That position has a name. It is called unreviewable discretion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Act Itself</p>\n\n<p>The Alien Enemies Act dates to 1798. It authorizes the president, during declared war or invasion, to detain or deport nationals of hostile foreign powers. It has been used three times in our history: during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. Each time, it was invoked in the context of actual, declared war between nations.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela has not invaded the United States. Congress has not declared war. What exists instead is the government's assertion that Tren de Aragua constitutes an invasion, and that this assertion alone triggers authority under a statute designed for armed conflict between sovereign states.</p>\n\n<p>This is not originalism. This is not even creative interpretation. This is taking language written for one context and applying it to another because the language is broad enough to bear the weight.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Tren de Aragua is dangerous. Criminal organizations are dangerous. The question is whether danger alone converts police work into war, and whether calling something an invasion makes it one for constitutional purposes.</p>\n\n<p>If it does, there is no limiting principle. Any transnational criminal network becomes an invading force. Any executive can invoke wartime authority without asking Congress to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>## What Due Process Requires</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Amendment is nine words long in the relevant part: \"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not \"no citizen.\" No person.</p>\n\n<p>Due process does not mean the government cannot deport people. It means the government must provide some opportunity to contest the grounds for deportation before it acts. That opportunity can be brief. It can be limited. But it must exist.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg's ruling does not say the government was wrong to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. It does not say the men must be granted asylum, or released, or allowed to remain in the United States. It says only that they are entitled to a hearing—a chance to show that the government's factual basis for calling them gang members is mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>The administration argued that providing such hearings was impractical. The men had already been deported. They were in El Salvador, then Venezuela. Bringing them back would be costly and complicated.</p>\n\n<p>True enough.</p>\n\n<p>But the impracticality is the government's own creation. The men would still be in the United States, able to appear before an immigration judge, if the executive had not sent them to El Salvador hours after a federal court said not to.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot manufacture your own emergency and then cite the emergency as grounds for denying rights.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>This case will be remembered not for what happened to 137 Venezuelans, but for what it establishes about executive power in immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>If the government can deport people to foreign custody before a court order takes effect, and then argue that their deportation makes judicial review impractical, then every future administration has a roadmap. Act fast enough, move people far enough, and the courts cannot reach them.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a bug in the government's theory. It is the theory.</p>\n\n<p>The Justice Department did not apologize for defying Judge Boasberg's order. It argued that the order was invalid from the start—that courts have no role in reviewing deportations conducted under the Alien Enemies Act, or at least no role that can be exercised quickly enough to matter.</p>\n\n<p>If that argument prevails, the constitutional consequence is clear: There will be a category of executive action that is, for all practical purposes, unreviewable. Not because the law prohibits review, but because the government can complete the action before review occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Speed becomes immunity.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>Judge Boasberg also found probable cause to hold the administration in criminal contempt for violating his March order. The appellate court has paused that proceeding, but the question remains: What happens when the executive branch ignores a judicial order?</p>\n\n<p>In a system of separated powers, the answer cannot be \"nothing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Contempt is not a political weapon. It is the judiciary's tool for enforcing its own judgments. Without it, court orders become suggestions. The executive obeys when it agrees, defies when it does not, and suffers no consequence either way.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a constitutional republic operates. That is how power consolidates.</p>\n\n<p>The men in this case have since been returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange. Their immediate circumstances have changed. But the precedent remains. The next group of people subjected to expedited removal under the Alien Enemies Act, or any other authority the executive claims is beyond judicial reach, will face the same problem: by the time a court can rule, they will already be gone.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>This is not about immigration policy. Reasonable people can disagree about how many people should be admitted, under what conditions, and what should happen to those who enter unlawfully. Those are legitimate political questions.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether the executive branch must allow judicial review of its factual determinations before acting, or whether asserting urgency and foreign policy concerns exempts it from that requirement.</p>\n\n<p>If the latter, then we have redefined what \"due process\" means. It no longer means an opportunity to be heard before deprivation. It means an opportunity the government will provide if convenient, and decline if not.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a small change. It is a transformation of the relationship between the citizen—or the person, because the Constitution says person—and the state.</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist 47 that \"the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands\" is \"the very definition of tyranny.\" He was describing concentration within a single branch. But the same danger exists when one branch can act beyond the reach of the others—when it moves too fast for law to catch it, and then argues that speed itself makes accountability impossible.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that principle tested.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether Judge Boasberg's ruling will stand, or whether the government's theory will prevail: that in matters the executive declares urgent, involving people it declares dangerous, the constitutional requirement of due process dissolves into discretion.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in uniform. I understand operational necessity. I also understand the difference between a military operation conducted under legal authority and the seizure of assets that belongs in a different century entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The United States has deployed 15,000 troops to the Caribbean, ordered a naval blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers, seized at least two vessels, announced it will keep or sell both the ships and their cargo, and stated it is pursuing a third. The largest deployment to the region since the 1989 Panama invasion. The president has declared he will appropriate the property of a sovereign nation without compensation, without judicial process, without treaty authorization.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Venezuela's government. This is about what power claims it may do.</p>\n\n<p>## The Authority Question</p>\n\n<p>The stated justification is drug interdiction. Fentanyl, cocaine, organized crime. Legitimate national security concerns, all of them. But the constitutional framework for using military force abroad is narrow and specific. Congress declares war. The president may act in genuine emergencies under the War Powers Resolution. Treaty obligations create mutual defense commitments within defined boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is none of these things.</p>\n\n<p>A blockade is an act of war under international law. Seizing commercial vessels on the high seas and declaring you will sell their cargo is, as Venezuela's UN ambassador noted, difficult to distinguish from piracy. The United States does not recognize the Maduro government as legitimate. Fair enough. But non-recognition does not grant authority to appropriate property. If it did, we could seize the assets of every government we consider illegitimate. That is not law. That is might.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Ambassador to the UN offered this defense: \"Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claims to power and his narco-terrorist activities.\" Perhaps true. But the Constitution does not authorize the president to decide which foreign leaders are legitimate, seize their nations' resources, and redistribute them as he sees fit. That power, if it exists at all, would require congressional authorization. It would require a legal framework. It would require something other than a presidential announcement that we are taking ships and keeping what we find.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern That Should Concern Us</p>\n\n<p>This is the fourth such operation in recent months. More than 20 vessels targeted in the Pacific and Caribbean. At least 90 people killed in strikes the administration describes as counter-gang operations. Some legal experts suggest these actions may violate the laws of armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether drug trafficking is a serious problem. It is. The question is whether the seriousness of the problem justifies abandoning the legal constraints that distinguish a republic from an empire.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the mechanism. The president declares a threat. The president orders military action. The president seizes property. The president announces he will liquidate that property for U.S. benefit. Where in that sequence is congressional authorization? Where is judicial review? Where is the check on executive power that prevents \"national security\" from becoming a blank authorization for anything the president deems necessary?</p>\n\n<p>This is not hypothetical. I watched extraordinary authorities granted after September 11th become permanent features of government. Temporary surveillance powers that were never relinquished. Detention policies that started as emergency measures and became standard procedure. The slow migration from \"we must do this now\" to \"this is simply what we do.\"</p>\n\n<p>## What the Framers Understood</p>\n\n<p>The men who wrote the Constitution had recent experience with unchecked executive power. They had lived under a king who claimed the authority to seize property, wage war, and govern by decree. They designed a system specifically to prevent that concentration of power in one person.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison, Federalist 47: \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"</p>\n\n<p>We are watching the accumulation Madison warned against. Not through dramatic coup, but through the quiet assertion that the president may do what he judges necessary. That military force may be deployed, ships seized, and property liquidated based on executive determination alone. That the complexity of modern threats requires we trust the judgment of whoever holds the office.</p>\n\n<p>The Framers would not have trusted that judgment. They did not design a system that required trusting it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent</p>\n\n<p>Russia's UN ambassador called this \"a template for future acts of force against Latin American states.\" He is not wrong to worry. If the United States may seize the assets of any nation whose government we consider illegitimate, whose oil sales we believe fund activities we oppose, then we have announced a doctrine with no limiting principle.</p>\n\n<p>Today it is Venezuela and drug trafficking. Tomorrow it could be any nation, any resource, any stated justification. The legal architecture, once abandoned, is difficult to rebuild. The precedent, once set, becomes permission.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics drift toward something else. Not through sudden transformation, but through the steady expansion of what power claims it may do without asking permission.</p>\n\n<p>## What Should Be Asked</p>\n\n<p>Is there congressional authorization for this blockade?</p>\n\n<p>Under what legal framework does the president claim authority to seize foreign commercial vessels and appropriate their cargo?</p>\n\n<p>If this action is justified by Venezuela's status as a narco-state, what prevents the same reasoning from applying to any nation we accuse of facilitating drug trade?</p>\n\n<p>Who reviews these decisions? Who checks them?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is \"the president decides,\" then we have answered a different question than we intended.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>The argument will be made that this is different. That Venezuela is uniquely problematic, that Maduro is uniquely illegitimate, that the drug crisis is uniquely urgent. Perhaps. But constitutional principle does not operate on a curve graded by how much we dislike the target.</p>\n\n<p>Either we are a nation that operates under law, or we are a nation that operates under power. Either military force abroad requires legal authorization, or it requires only executive will. Either property seizures follow due process, or they follow presidential announcement.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot be both. And we are deciding, right now, which we will be.</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath did not include an asterisk for difficult cases. It did not include an exception for serious threats. It meant what it said: that the framework matters more than the outcome, that the process protects everyone, and that power exercised without legal constraint is not legitimate power regardless of its objective.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about defending Venezuela's government. This is about defending the system that prevents any government, including ours, from doing whatever it believes necessary.</p>\n\n<p>That system is being tested. The test is happening now.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The Department of Justice announced this week that it has discovered more than a million additional documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. They promise release \"in the coming days and weeks.\" The statement did not explain how these documents, which presumably existed during the initial review, were only now discovered.</p>\n\n<p>That's the detail that matters.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Epstein. The crimes are known. The victims are known. The dead cannot be brought to trial.</p>\n\n<p>This is about what a government owes its people when it says \"we have disclosed everything,\" and then months later says \"we have found a million more pages.\"</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in government service. I've reviewed classified materials under deadline pressure. I know what \"we're working around the clock\" means when spoken by lawyers protecting institutional interests rather than serving constitutional obligations.</p>\n\n<p>It means the clock started late.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We've Seen Before</p>\n\n<p>Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The law was specific: release all documents, redact only to protect victims and active investigations, do not redact to prevent embarrassment or reputational harm, and meet a deadline of December 19.</p>\n\n<p>The Department missed the deadline.</p>\n\n<p>The initial releases were heavily redacted, including names of possible co-conspirators whom the FBI had served with subpoenas in 2019. Lawmakers from both parties objected. The law clearly prohibited those redactions.</p>\n\n<p>Now we learn there are a million more documents that somehow weren't part of the initial inventory.</p>\n\n<p>The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required full disclosure by 2017. In 2017, agencies requested more time. They are still requesting more time. Documents from 1963 remain classified in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is this: Congress passes a transparency law. Agencies comply minimally. Years pass. The public's attention moves on. What was mandatory becomes negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>The law does not enforce itself.</p>\n\n<p>## What \"Review\" Means</p>\n\n<p>The Department says lawyers are \"working around the clock\" to review these newly discovered documents. This is presented as diligence. It is more accurately described as delay.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act is explicit about what may be redacted: victim identities and information that would compromise active criminal investigations. That's it. The law specifically states that embarrassment and reputational harm are not grounds for redaction.</p>\n\n<p>If the law means what it says, review should be straightforward. Find victim names, redact them. Check for overlap with ongoing prosecutions, redact those specific items. Release everything else.</p>\n\n<p>If review takes \"a few more weeks\" for a million documents, that's not document review. That's interest balancing. It's deciding which powerful people can be protected under a permissive interpretation of \"active investigation.\" It's determining how much the statute really means.</p>\n\n<p>This is how law stops being law and becomes suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>I've been part of classification reviews. When institutions want transparency, documents move quickly. When they don't, every page requires three meetings and a legal memo.</p>\n\n<p>Speed reveals intent.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Co-Conspirators</p>\n\n<p>Embedded in the already-released documents are FBI emails from 2019 mentioning ten possible co-conspirators. Six had been served with subpoenas. Three in Florida. One in Boston. One in New York. One in Connecticut.</p>\n\n<p>Their names are redacted.</p>\n\n<p>The law prohibits redaction to prevent embarrassment. Were these six people charged? If not, on what basis did the FBI decline prosecution? Those are the internal communications and memos the statute specifically requires.</p>\n\n<p>Epstein died in federal custody in 2019. Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2022. The investigation is not new. The FBI identified possible co-conspirators, served them with subpoenas, and made charging decisions years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Why are we still waiting to know who they were and why they weren't charged?</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a question about Jeffrey Epstein. It's a question about whether law applies differently to people with power and proximity to power.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then we do not have equal justice. We have a system where connection determines consequence. And if that's the system, citizens deserve to know it plainly rather than discover it through redaction patterns and missed deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Requires</p>\n\n<p>Transparency is not a favor governments grant when convenient. It is a structural requirement of legitimate authority.</p>\n\n<p>When Congress passes a law requiring disclosure, that law represents the people's judgment that they are entitled to know what their government did and did not do. The executive branch does not have discretion to comply partially or slowly unless the law provides that discretion.</p>\n\n<p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act provided limited discretion: protect victims and active investigations. Everything else must be released.</p>\n\n<p>If a million documents were somehow overlooked, that is not a reason for more time. It is evidence that the initial review was inadequate. The remedy is not another months-long review at the same pace. The remedy is to release everything not clearly covered by the two statutory exceptions, and let citizens see what their government has been doing.</p>\n\n<p>Trust is not rebuilt through promises of future transparency. It is rebuilt through present action.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>This case will clarify something important. Either the law means what it says, or it means what is convenient.</p>\n\n<p>If names are redacted because releasing them would be embarrassing, the law has been broken, and Congress should enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>If the \"review process\" continues indefinitely while public attention wanes, we will know that transparency laws are performative, not binding.</p>\n\n<p>If co-conspirators who were investigated but not charged remain unnamed because they are powerful or connected, we will know that equal justice is an aspiration rather than a practice.</p>\n\n<p>The facts are straightforward. The law is clear. What happens next will tell us whether clarity matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I've worked in government buildings named for people who served this country. You walk through those halls conscious of the names on the walls, the portraits in the lobbies, the dedications carved in stone. They aren't decorations. They're reminders of what the institution is supposed to serve.</p>\n\n<p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was created by federal law. Congress authorized it. Congress funded it. Congress named it after a president who had been assassinated in office. The statute establishing it, Public Law 88-260, enacted January 23, 1964, declares it \"a living memorial\" and \"the National Center for the Performing Arts.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not political preference. That's law.</p>\n\n<p>Now the sitting president has placed his own name on that memorial. A board he reconstituted voted unanimously to rename it. A congresswoman designated by statute as a board member says she was muted when she tried to object. The name went up on the building within hours.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about partisan alignment. This is about whether federal law governs federal property, or whether control of appointments means control of outcomes previously thought to be fixed by statute.</p>\n\n<p>## The Legal Question Nobody Is Answering</p>\n\n<p>Representative Beatty's lawsuit argues that renaming the Kennedy Center requires an act of Congress, not a board resolution. The White House says the board acted properly under its authority.</p>\n\n<p>That's a factual legal question with a factual legal answer.</p>\n\n<p>Either the authorizing statute allows the board to change the name of the institution, or it doesn't. Either Congress retains authority over the designation of federal memorials it creates, or control passes entirely to whoever holds appointment power over the board.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what we know: Public Law 88-260 names the institution. It doesn't delegate naming authority to the board. It establishes the center as a memorial to John F. Kennedy. The Supreme Court has long held that when Congress creates something by statute and specifies its essential characteristics, those characteristics cannot be altered except by Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The board has authority over operations, programming, fundraising. That's governance. Changing the name of a congressionally designated memorial is not governance. It's revision of the statute itself.</p>\n\n<p>If a board vote can rename a federal memorial established by law, then law is subordinate to appointment power. That's not a small shift. That's the difference between a government of laws and a government of loyalties.</p>\n\n<p>## How Boards Become Instruments</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after taking office, President Trump removed multiple Kennedy Center board members and replaced them with appointees. Thirty-four of fifty-seven members now serve at his appointment. His close adviser became board president. He became board chairman.</p>\n\n<p>That's within presidential authority. Appointment power is real power.</p>\n\n<p>But when appointment power converts a statutory board into a unanimous instrument, we're watching something beyond normal governance. When a congresswoman says she was silenced during a vote to alter what Congress created by law, we're watching process become performance.</p>\n\n<p>The White House statement justifies the name change by citing Trump's financial support for the center, his securing of congressional appropriations, his leadership of renovations. All of that may be true. None of it changes what statute requires.</p>\n\n<p>You don't earn the right to rename federal memorials by funding them. If that were the standard, every major donor could demand naming rights over national institutions. The Lincoln Memorial would be available for the highest bidder with enough friends in the right positions.</p>\n\n<p>This is why memorials are created by law, not by board resolution.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We're Watching</p>\n\n<p>This isn't the first time statutory constraints have dissolved under appointment power. It won't be the last.</p>\n\n<p>What's being normalized is the idea that control over an institution's board means control over the institution's identity, regardless of what the statute establishing it provides. That the person who appoints can become the thing appointed. That what Congress designates by law can be redesignated by voice vote if enough board seats change hands.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this pattern before, not in memorials but in regulatory agencies, in inspector general offices, in bodies designed to operate with some independence from the executive. First, the appointments change. Then the interpretations shift. Then what was considered legally fixed becomes practically negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>Each step seems defensible in isolation. This appointment was lawful. That vote was procedurally proper. This interpretation is within discretion.</p>\n\n<p>But the cumulative effect is the conversion of institutions from entities bound by statute into extensions of whoever controls the appointments.</p>\n\n<p>## What Joe Kennedy III Said</p>\n\n<p>Joe Kennedy III, former congressman and grandnephew of the president whose name Congress placed on the center, said: \"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial.\"</p>\n\n<p>He's right about the principle. The question is whether the principle still governs.</p>\n\n<p>If a board vote can rename the Kennedy Center, can a board vote rename Arlington National Cemetery? Can it redesignate the Washington Monument? Can it alter the Jefferson Memorial? All are federal property. All were designated by acts of Congress. All have boards or commissions that could, if appointment power is sufficient, vote to revise what Congress established.</p>\n\n<p>The answer should be no, because federal law constrains federal boards. But if the answer is yes when the votes align, then we've redefined what \"established by law\" means. It means established until a different political coalition controls the appointments.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Here</p>\n\n<p>A lawsuit will determine whether Representative Beatty is correct that statute prevents what the board approved. The court will decide whether congressional designation of a memorial is binding or advisory, whether a board created to govern operations can alter the institution's statutory identity, whether appointment power extends to rewriting the terms under which institutions were created.</p>\n\n<p>That decision matters beyond one building.</p>\n\n<p>If courts hold that boards have inherent authority to rename institutions regardless of statutory language, then every federal entity designated by Congress becomes contingent on who holds appointment power at any given time. Memorials become negotiable. Statutory designations become suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>If courts hold that Congress retains authority over what it creates by law unless it explicitly delegates naming authority, then law still constrains boards, and memorials remain what Congress made them.</p>\n\n<p>The broader question is whether we still distinguish between operating an institution and redefining it, between managing within statutory bounds and rewriting the statute through board action, between normal exercise of appointment power and conversion of that power into control over an institution's legal identity.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction used to be clear. If it's eroding, we should notice.</p>\n\n<p>The name is on the building now. The website is changed. The decision has been executed before the lawsuit can be heard. That's not unusual in modern governance, but it's telling. When changes happen faster than law can review them, execution becomes the argument for legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about honoring one president or another. This is about whether federal law still governs federal property when appointment power says otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>That question, in a republic, should have only one answer.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have watched governments fall. I have seen coups unfold. I have served in regions where the difference between legitimate authority and raw power was measured in the willingness to use force against citizens.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in Myanmar is not an election. It is a performance of legitimacy staged at gunpoint.</p>\n\n<p>The military junta is holding what it calls \"phased elections\" beginning December 28. Nearly 100 people have been arrested for questioning this process. Some face prison for clicking \"like\" on social media posts critical of the vote. The opposition National League for Democracy is banned. Its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been imprisoned since the 2021 coup. Her son recently told reporters, \"For all I know, she could be dead.\"</p>\n\n<p>The military admits the vote will not be held in half the country, the contested and rebel-held areas.</p>\n\n<p>The United Nations Secretary General asked the obvious question: \"Is there anyone who believes that there will be free and fair elections in Myanmar?\"</p>\n\n<p>But here is the question beneath that question: What happens when a government performs the rituals of democracy while systematically destroying its substance?</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Myanmar's internal politics. This is about the mechanics of legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>**The Architecture of Sham Democracy**</p>\n\n<p>Elections are not merely procedures. They are the foundational mechanism by which free people delegate authority and retain the power to revoke it. When a government holds an election it controls completely, bans opposition parties, imprisons critics, and deploys force to ensure the desired outcome, it is not seeking the consent of the governed. It is demanding the performance of consent.</p>\n\n<p>The junta has passed laws criminalizing \"interference\" in the election. That word carries the full weight of state power: 200 arrests and counting for social media posts, for expressing doubt, for failing to participate in the charade.</p>\n\n<p>This is not election administration. This is compelled speech.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" The entire structure of constitutional government rests on the assumption that those who hold power must be accountable to those they govern. That accountability requires more than the theater of voting. It requires the genuine possibility of losing power.</p>\n\n<p>What Myanmar's military has constructed is a system where elections exist not as instruments of accountability but as rituals of submission.</p>\n\n<p>**The Exhaustion of Resistance**</p>\n\n<p>Here is what five years of civil war does to a population: it creates a longing for anything that resembles stability, even if that stability is the boot heel of military rule.</p>\n\n<p>Analyst David Mathieson reports hearing from citizens who say, \"We hate the regime, but at least they've got a plan, they've got a way to kind of get us out of this and stabilize.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not endorsement. That is capitulation born of exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p>This is how extraordinary measures become normalized. Not through persuasion or even through force alone, but through the grinding down of alternatives until people accept unfreedom as the price of predictability.</p>\n\n<p>Ko Ta Mar, a doctor who became a rebel commander, calls the election \"like injecting steroids into a patient. The pain can be eased temporarily, but it will be worse in the long term.\"</p>\n\n<p>He is describing the difference between symptom relief and cure, between the appearance of legitimacy and its substance. But after nearly five years of war, economic collapse, and displacement affecting millions, many citizens simply want the pain to stop, even temporarily, even if it means accepting a government they did not choose.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Myanmar's people prefer the junta. The question is whether they have been given any meaningful choice at all.</p>\n\n<p>**When Legitimacy Becomes Transactional**</p>\n\n<p>China has endorsed Myanmar's election. So has Russia. India maintains ambiguous support. Beijing's calculation is coldly practical: the military junta is \"a necessary evil\" that serves Chinese strategic interests better than continued chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Yun Sun of the Stimson Center explains China's position: \"Five years of civil war did not kick them out, and the Chinese will not tilt the balance of power in a way that the military will be forced out.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is legitimacy as transaction. Not legitimacy earned through the consent of the governed, but legitimacy purchased through the endorsement of powerful neighbors who value stability over freedom.</p>\n\n<p>China has pressured ethnic armed groups to stop fighting the junta. It has restricted weapons supplies to opposition forces. It has treated Myanmar's election not as a question of democratic principle but as an instrument of regional order.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question here extends beyond Myanmar's borders: When powerful states recognize and validate governments that lack domestic legitimacy, do they create a separate category of international legitimacy that exists independent of popular consent?</p>\n\n<p>This is not a new question. It was the question at the heart of the Cold War, when the United States and Soviet Union both propped up client regimes regardless of how those regimes came to power. But it remains urgent because it determines whether popular sovereignty is a universal principle or merely a preferred arrangement in friendly nations.</p>\n\n<p>**What Is Being Normalized**</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's election will likely produce a parliament dominated by the military's proxy party. The junta will declare the result a mandate. Some nations will accept that claim. The military will use the election as evidence of restored constitutional order, even as opposition leaders remain in prison and half the country remains too dangerous to vote.</p>\n\n<p>What is being established here is a precedent: that the forms of democracy can substitute for its substance, that elections can exist without genuine choice, that governments can claim legitimacy through processes they control completely.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an Asian problem or a developing world problem. It is the central question of republican government: whether authority derives from the consent of the governed or merely from the successful monopolization of force.</p>\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin, emerging from the Constitutional Convention in 1787, was asked what kind of government the delegates had created. He replied: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"</p>\n\n<p>The keeping of a republic requires constant vigilance against the substitution of process for principle, against the performance of democracy without its substance, against elections that function as referenda on submission rather than instruments of choice.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's military is gambling that exhaustion will produce acquiescence, that the appearance of normalcy will be accepted as normalcy itself, that international recognition will substitute for domestic legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>The gamble may work. Five years of war have worn down resistance. China's support provides economic lifelines and diplomatic cover. The opposition remains fractured and outgunned.</p>\n\n<p>But what succeeds tactically may fail constitutionally. A government that must imprison critics to hold elections, that must ban opposition parties to ensure victory, that must control half the country by force to govern the other half through votes, has not achieved legitimacy. It has achieved compliance.</p>\n\n<p>The difference matters. Compliance is temporary. It lasts only as long as force can be maintained. Legitimacy is durable. It survives changes in leadership and shifts in power because it rests on consent rather than coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar's military is constructing a house of cards and calling it a foundation. The structure may stand for years. It may even function as government. But it will not be legitimate, no matter how many elections it holds or how many foreign powers recognize the result.</p>\n\n<p>The test is simple: Can the people change their government through peaceful means? If the answer is no, the government does not rest on consent. If the government does not rest on consent, it is not legitimate, no matter what forms it observes or what elections it holds.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a partisan claim. That is constitutional bedrock.</p>\n\n<p>The question for the rest of us is whether we are prepared to say so.</p>",

The alarm sounds. On screen, missiles rise in balls of fire. Mushroom clouds blossom across the planet.</p>\n\n<p>It's a macabre tourist attraction now. Once it was Ukraine's insurance policy.</p>\n\n<p>In 1994, Ukraine possessed the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. Ten years later, every warhead was gone, dismantled under the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and Britain. The terms were clear: Ukraine would surrender its nuclear weapons. In exchange, the three co-signers guaranteed Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>Russia invaded in 2014. It invaded again in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a story about nuclear proliferation. This is a story about what happens when security guarantees are worth less than the paper they're written on.</p>\n\n<p>**When Assurances Replace Obligation**</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum was not a treaty. That matters.</p>\n\n<p>A treaty requires Senate ratification under Article II of the Constitution. It creates binding obligations enforceable under international law. The Budapest Memorandum was a political commitment, a gentleman's agreement among nuclear powers that one of them would not invade the country that had just given up the means to defend itself.</p>\n\n<p>President Clinton called it \"a hopeful and historic breakthrough.\" Ukraine's then-president, Leonid Kravchuk, believed the word of three nuclear powers meant something.</p>\n\n<p>The museum guide, Hennadiy Vladimirovitch Fil, says hardly anyone of a certain age leaves without cursing. They understand now what they gave away. Denmark's ambassador to Kyiv, visiting the museum, calls it \"a disgrace.\" Even Clinton later admitted: \"I feel terrible about it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Words without enforcement are wishes. Security without accountability is theater.</p>\n\n<p>**The Architecture of Deterrence**</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that republics survive not through the goodwill of other nations but through the credible threat of force. As Hamilton wrote in Federalist 34, \"A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine's nuclear arsenal was precisely such a power. Ten ICBMs, each carrying ten warheads, each capable of obliterating 77,000 square miles. These were not symbolic weapons. They were instruments of mutual assured destruction, the Cold War doctrine that kept the peace precisely because no rational actor would risk annihilation.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine surrendered that deterrent on the promise that it wouldn't need it.</p>\n\n<p>Russia tested the promise in 2014 with Crimea. The West condemned the action but took no military steps to reverse it. The promise held as long as Russia chose not to break it further. In 2022, Russia broke it entirely.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when deterrence rests on assurances rather than capability. The strong do what they can. The weak suffer what they must.</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Good Faith**</p>\n\n<p>Museum visitors watch a simulation of nuclear war: oxygen depleting from the atmosphere, life ending on the planet. Fil is grateful it never came to that. But he regrets that Ukraine gave up its weapons.</p>\n\n<p>The regret is not about wanting nuclear war. It's about recognizing that the international order operates not on justice but on power.</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum assumed good faith from all signatories. It assumed that Russia, having just emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union, would respect the sovereignty of its neighbors. It assumed that the United States and Britain, having brokered the deal, would enforce it if Russia didn't.</p>\n\n<p>All three assumptions were wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution does not assume good faith. It constructs a government on the premise that people are not angels. As Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>The international order assumed angels. Ukraine is paying the price.</p>\n\n<p>**What This Museum Teaches**</p>\n\n<p>The Museum of Strategic Missile Forces is a warning in concrete and steel. It documents how a nation voluntarily disarmed, how it trusted written assurances from nuclear powers, and how those assurances collapsed the moment they were tested.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is now demanding \"ironclad security guarantees\" as part of any peace deal with Russia. The word \"ironclad\" is doing heavy lifting. What makes a guarantee ironclad? Not signatures. Not diplomatic language. Not the prestige of the signatories.</p>\n\n<p>Guarantees are ironclad when they are backed by the credible threat of enforcement. Treaties work when violation carries consequences that the violator cannot afford. The Budapest Memorandum failed because Russia calculated, correctly, that it could invade without triggering a military response from the other signatories.</p>\n\n<p>A museum guide who once served in the Soviet rocket forces now takes tourists underground to press a launch button that does nothing. The missiles are gone. The silos are filled with concrete. The deterrent is a historical exhibit.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when nations trade power for promises.</p>\n\n<p>**The Constitutional Question**</p>\n\n<p>The United States did not violate the Constitution by signing the Budapest Memorandum. The executive branch has authority to conduct foreign policy and enter into non-treaty agreements. But the decision to use a memorandum rather than a treaty meant that the commitment had no force of law, no mechanism for enforcement, and no obligation beyond diplomatic pressure.</p>\n\n<p>The Senate never voted on whether to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity. The American people never consented to a binding obligation. The memorandum allowed the executive branch to project the appearance of a security guarantee without accepting the accountability that comes with one.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about whether the United States should have gone to war to defend Ukraine in 2014 or 2022. This is about whether we should have made a promise we had no intention of keeping.</p>\n\n<p>When the executive branch makes commitments that look like treaties but lack treaty obligations, it creates confusion about what America actually stands behind. It encourages allies to trust assurances that may not hold. It teaches adversaries that American promises are negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>The museum in Ukraine stands as a monument to that confusion.</p>\n\n<p>**What Visitors Learn**</p>\n\n<p>They learn that nuclear weapons are terrible. They learn that the Cold War arms race brought humanity to the edge of extinction. They learn that Ukraine once had the power to destroy cities on another continent and gave it up in the name of peace.</p>\n\n<p>They also learn that power, once surrendered, is not returned when you need it most.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Ukraine should have kept its nuclear weapons. The question is whether great powers should make security guarantees they cannot or will not enforce. The question is whether assurances without accountability serve any purpose beyond postponing the inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine believed the promises of three nuclear powers. Russia broke its promise. The United States and Britain honored theirs only through diplomatic protest.</p>\n\n<p>The museum guide, Hennadiy Fil, now shows tourists how to simulate launching missiles that no longer exist. The button still works. The alarm still sounds. On screen, the world still ends.</p>\n\n<p>But the real missiles were destroyed in the 1990s, filled with concrete, turned into museum pieces. Ukraine trusted that it wouldn't need them.</p>\n\n<p>That trust is what the museum commemorates. Not just the weapons. The belief that written assurances from powerful nations meant something.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in the Pacific. I know what military exercises are. They are rehearsals.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing around Taiwan is not posturing. It is preparation.</p>\n\n<p>On December 29, the People's Liberation Army conducted joint drills encircling Taiwan—air, navy, rocket forces. Live fire scheduled. Five zones marked. Beijing called it a \"stern warning\" against separatism and external interference. Taiwan called it aggression. Both statements are true. Neither captures what is actually happening.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Taiwan's status. That question has been unresolved since 1949. This is about whether international order rests on law or on the willingness to enforce it.</p>\n\n<p>## What Changed</p>\n\n<p>Three things converged to trigger these drills: a $10 billion U.S. arms package to Taiwan, Japan's new prime minister stating Tokyo might intervene militarily if China moves on Taiwan, and the routine reality that Beijing sends warplanes and naval vessels toward the island nearly every day.</p>\n\n<p>That last point matters most.</p>\n\n<p>These exercises are no longer exceptional. They are regular. What was once crisis is now pattern. Beijing has normalized military pressure to the point where live-fire drills around a democratic nation of 23 million people barely register as news.</p>\n\n<p>The normalization of the extraordinary is how republics lose their way.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States is obligated to assist Taiwan's defense. That law emerged from a specific compromise: President Carter's administration recognized Beijing diplomatically while maintaining an informal commitment to Taiwan's security. For decades, this arrangement preserved an uneasy peace.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether that obligation retains meaning when the threat is constant rather than acute.</p>\n\n<p>When military exercises become daily background noise, when blockade rehearsals happen on a schedule, when \"precision strikes on key targets\" are announced in press releases, the nature of the threat has changed. It is no longer a crisis that might be deterred. It is a steady pressure designed to exhaust resistance before force is ever used.</p>\n\n<p>This matters constitutionally because it tests whether treaty obligations and statutory commitments can function when the adversary operates below the threshold that triggers response. Beijing is not invading Taiwan. It is surrounding it, drilling around it, flying over it, testing it. At what point does that pattern constitute the threat the Taiwan Relations Act was designed to address?</p>\n\n<p>Congress has not answered that question. It may not be answerable in advance. But the failure to ask it aloud means we are drifting toward a moment when the question will be answered by events rather than by deliberate choice.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>What is happening around Taiwan is being watched everywhere territorial disputes remain unresolved. The lesson being transmitted is this: if you have the patience and the military capacity to make the extraordinary routine, you can shift facts on the ground without firing a shot.</p>\n\n<p>This is not new in history. It is how empires have expanded for millennia. What is new is the precision with which it can be executed and the speed with which democratic publics become desensitized to it.</p>\n\n<p>When I was in uniform, we understood that readiness was not just about our own capability. It was about credibility. The adversary had to believe we would do what we said we would do. That belief was the deterrent. The moment that belief weakened, the deterrent collapsed, and the cost of restoring it became exponentially higher.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, credibility is being tested daily. Not through dramatic confrontation, but through incremental pressure that forces the question: at what point does the United States honor its commitment, and how will it know when that point has arrived?</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals About Power and Accountability</p>\n\n<p>The drills around Taiwan expose a deeper problem: the gap between stated policy and operational reality. Washington has committed to Taiwan's defense. But that commitment has never been defined with precision. It rests on strategic ambiguity, a doctrine that worked for decades but may no longer function when the threat is not a singular invasion but a slow encirclement.</p>\n\n<p>Strategic ambiguity requires restraint on all sides. It requires Beijing to refrain from forcing the issue and Washington to refrain from clarifying its response. But when one side stops exercising restraint, the ambiguity collapses. What remains is not strategy but drift.</p>\n\n<p>This is the accountability question: Who decides when the commitment is triggered? The President? Congress? A general in the field reading radar screens as Chinese aircraft approach Taiwan's air defense zone for the 300th time this year?</p>\n\n<p>If that decision is left undefined, it will be made in crisis, under pressure, with incomplete information. That is how wars begin that no one intended to fight.</p>\n\n<p>## The Historical Echo</p>\n\n<p>There is a parallel here to the 1930s, though not the one usually invoked. This is not about appeasement in the face of open aggression. This is about the slow accumulation of facts that make aggression seem inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Before 1939, there were remilitarizations, annexations, provocations. Each one tested whether the international order would respond. Each time the response was delayed or diluted, the next provocation became easier. The problem was not that democracies failed to recognize the threat. The problem was that they failed to recognize the cumulative weight of small violations.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching that accumulation now. Not in Europe, but in the Pacific. Not with tanks rolling across borders, but with naval forces surrounding an island, air forces penetrating airspace, and rocket forces rehearsing strikes.</p>\n\n<p>The accumulation is the threat. The normalization is the danger.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>Here is the question that is not being asked: What is the constitutional process by which the United States would honor its commitment to Taiwan?</p>\n\n<p>Not the moral question. Not the strategic question. The constitutional question.</p>\n\n<p>If Beijing blockades Taiwan, does the President have authority to respond militarily without congressional authorization? If Congress has that authority, has it delegated it through the Taiwan Relations Act, or must it vote again? If a vote is required, how quickly can it happen when the window for effective response may be measured in hours?</p>\n\n<p>These are not abstract questions. They are the questions that determine whether our commitments are real or rhetorical.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that the power to make war had to be shared between Congress and the executive precisely because war was too consequential to be left to any single authority. But they also understood that speed sometimes mattered, which is why the President commands the armed forces once war is authorized.</p>\n\n<p>What they did not envision was a world where war could be waged incrementally, where the line between peace and conflict could be so blurred that no one could say with certainty when it had been crossed.</p>\n\n<p>That is the world we inhabit now. And our constitutional system has not adapted to it.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Means for Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy in a republic rests on consent. The people, through their representatives, decide when to go to war. That principle is foundational. It is why the Constitution gives Congress, not the President, the power to declare war.</p>\n\n<p>But if military conflict can begin without a declaration, if commitments can be triggered without a vote, if the executive can commit forces based on decades-old statutory language that was intentionally ambiguous, then the consent of the governed becomes theoretical rather than real.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an argument against defending Taiwan. It is an argument for clarity about how that defense would be authorized and by whom.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we have neither clarity nor public debate. We have policy by drift, strategy by assumption, and commitment by implication. That is not how a constitutional republic is supposed to function.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>These drills are a test. Not just of military capability, but of political will. Not just of Taiwan's resilience, but of America's seriousness.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether the United States should defend Taiwan. The question is whether we have defined what defense means, authorized the means to carry it out, and prepared the public for what it might require.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer to any of those questions is no, then the commitment is hollow. And hollow commitments do not deter adversaries. They invite miscalculation.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 41 that the powers of government must be adequate to the security of the nation. Adequate. Not excessive, but sufficient. Right now, the adequacy of our constitutional process to meet the threat being rehearsed around Taiwan is unproven.</p>\n\n<p>That is the meaning of these drills. They are not just a rehearsal for Beijing. They are a test of whether our system can respond coherently when the threat arrives not as Pearl Harbor but as a thousand small incursions that accumulate into encirclement.</p>\n\n<p>The test is here.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served under commanders who understood that security guarantees mean something specific. They are not aspirations. They are commitments backed by the full weight of American power, and they bind not just one administration but the Republic itself.</p>\n\n<p>That's why what happened at Mar-a-Lago matters.</p>\n\n<p>The President of the United States offered Ukraine a fifteen-year security guarantee. The President of Ukraine asked for fifty. Both men spoke as if these were terms in a real estate negotiation, numbers to be haggled over, percentages to be quoted to reporters.</p>\n\n<p>Neither man appears to have asked the question that the Constitution requires: By what authority?</p>\n\n<p>## What a Guarantee Means</p>\n\n<p>A security guarantee is not a policy preference. It is a commitment that American forces will respond to aggression against another nation. It is, in substance if not in form, a mutual defense treaty.</p>\n\n<p>The North Atlantic Treaty, ratified in 1949, commits the United States to consider an armed attack against any NATO member as an attack against all. That commitment was approved by the Senate with a vote of 82-13. It has shaped American foreign policy for seventy-five years. Soldiers have deployed under its authority. Some have died under its flag.</p>\n\n<p>That treaty did not emerge from a resort in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>It was debated in the Senate. Witnesses testified. Amendments were proposed. The American people, through their elected representatives, decided whether this commitment was compatible with their security and their constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>The process was public. The vote was recorded. The obligation was clear.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We Are Watching</p>\n\n<p>What is being proposed now follows a different pattern.</p>\n\n<p>An executive commitment, negotiated privately, announced through press conferences, binding future administrations to obligations they did not approve and may not support. The Senate is not consulted. Treaties are not signed. Yet American credibility, and potentially American lives, are pledged.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time. It is the continuation of a shift that began decades ago.</p>\n\n<p>In 1973, President Nixon promised South Vietnam continued military support. Congress cut funding two years later. Saigon fell.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, the United States helped overthrow Libya's government without Congressional authorization, invoking an expansive interpretation of existing UN resolutions. The country remains fractured.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, President Obama declared that chemical weapons use in Syria would cross a \"red line.\" The line was crossed. No response followed. The commitment evaporated.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, the mechanism was the same: executive pronouncements treated as binding commitments, then abandoned or ignored when circumstances changed or political will shifted.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether any particular president is trustworthy. The question is whether commitments made without constitutional process are commitments at all.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Understood</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution vests the power to declare war in Congress. It requires Senate approval for treaties by a two-thirds vote. These are not procedural formalities. They are structural protections against executive overreach.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that the power to commit the nation to war must be separated from the power to wage it. Hamilton wrote in Federalist 69 that the president's authority as commander-in-chief \"would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces.\" The decision to deploy those forces in a binding commitment of collective defense was reserved to the legislative branch.</p>\n\n<p>This separation was not an accident. It was the lesson of history.</p>\n\n<p>Kings made alliances. Kings pledged support. Kings sent armies to honor commitments that subjects had not approved and could not escape. The Constitution was written to ensure that the American people, through their representatives, would decide which wars to fight and which commitments to honor.</p>\n\n<p>What we are watching is the quiet erosion of that principle.</p>\n\n<p>## The Mechanism of Evasion</p>\n\n<p>The word \"guarantee\" is being used carefully. It is not \"treaty.\" It is not \"alliance.\" It is not \"mutual defense.\" Those words trigger constitutional requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Instead we hear: partnership, framework, assurance, commitment. The language is deliberately vague. It suggests obligation without invoking process. It allows presidents to claim they have secured peace while avoiding the Senate vote that would test whether the commitment is real.</p>\n\n<p>This is not unique to Ukraine. It is the pattern of modern executive power.</p>\n\n<p>The Authorization for Use of Military Force, passed in 2001 to pursue those responsible for the September 11 attacks, has been used to justify military operations in at least nineteen countries. Presidents of both parties have invoked it. No new authorization has been sought. The war powers have effectively been transferred to the executive, constrained only by the willingness of Congress to defund operations after they begin.</p>\n\n<p>Security guarantees without Senate approval follow the same logic. They create facts on the ground. They generate expectations. They make it politically costly to reverse course. By the time Congress might object, the commitment is already operational.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how the Constitution distributes the war power.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Ukraine deserves support. The question is not whether peace in Europe serves American interests. Those are legitimate policy debates.</p>\n\n<p>The question is this: Can a president, acting alone, commit the United States to the defense of another nation?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then the treaty power is meaningless. If fifteen-year guarantees can be negotiated at Mar-a-Lago, then Senate ratification is a formality we have outgrown. If the credibility of the United States can be pledged in a press conference, then the constitutional process for making binding commitments is an anachronism.</p>\n\n<p>That answer would represent a fundamental change in our constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>It would mean that the decision to go to war, or to create conditions that make war likely, rests solely with whoever holds the executive office. It would mean that the check the Founders built into the system—the requirement that the people's representatives approve commitments that might cost American lives—has been bypassed.</p>\n\n<p>It would mean that the presidency has become what the Founders feared: a temporary kingship, constrained by elections but not by law.</p>\n\n<p>## What History Teaches</p>\n\n<p>Security guarantees made without constitutional process do not last. They collapse the moment political circumstances change. The commitments evaporate. The credibility is spent.</p>\n\n<p>The Budapest Memorandum of 1994 offered security assurances to Ukraine in exchange for surrendering its nuclear weapons. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia signed. Twenty years later, Russia invaded. The assurances proved empty.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between that memorandum and a Senate-ratified treaty is not rhetorical. It is constitutional. Treaties bind. Assurances do not. The distinction is not legalistic hairsplitting. It is the difference between a commitment enforceable under American law and a promise that evaporates when convenient.</p>\n\n<p>If we are serious about supporting Ukraine, the path is clear: negotiate a treaty, present it to the Senate, let the American people decide through their representatives whether this commitment is one they are willing to honor. If two-thirds of the Senate agrees, the commitment is real. If not, then we know the answer.</p>\n\n<p>What we are watching instead is the simulation of commitment without its substance.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath did not include a carve-out for foreign policy. It did not exempt security guarantees. It did not allow me to decide which parts of the constitutional order were binding and which were obsolete.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether that oath still governs.</p>\n\n<p>If presidents can commit the nation to war without Senate approval, if security guarantees can be negotiated in private and announced as fait accompli, if the treaty power can be bypassed through creative language and executive determination, then the constitutional structure is no longer operative. It has been replaced by something else: a system where power is checked only by the next election, not by law.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the system the Founders designed.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers being discussed—fifteen years, fifty years—are less important than the process being avoided. The percentages quoted—ninety percent, ninety-five percent—are less significant than the vote not being taken.</p>\n\n<p>The Senate exists for moments like this. The treaty power exists to ensure that commitments of American blood and treasure are made deliberately, publicly, and with the consent of the governed. If that process can be circumvented whenever a president decides it is inconvenient, then it is not a constitutional requirement. It is a suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>And suggestions do not bind.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength. But strength without legitimacy is only power. And power without process is what we fought a revolution to escape.</p>",

      "headline": "When Covert Becomes Overt: The CIA Strike in Venezuela and the Erosion of Restraint",
      "content": "<p>The CIA conducted a drone strike on Venezuelan soil last week. The President of the United States publicly acknowledged it. The agency declined to comment. Congress was presumably notified under covert action statutes, but the American people learned about it from the president's own words to a radio host.</p>\n\n<p>That sequence should trouble you.</p>\n\n<p>Not because of what happened in Venezuela. Not because of policy toward Maduro's narco-state. But because of what it reveals about how war powers now operate in this country.</p>\n\n<p>I served long enough to know that intelligence operations require secrecy. Covert action exists for good reason: some threats cannot be addressed through diplomacy or open military force. The National Security Act of 1947 established the CIA precisely because some missions require deniability. Congress codified oversight mechanisms after the Church Committee because covert action, by its nature, carries extraordinary risks.</p>\n\n<p>But something has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>The President is using the CIA to conduct what are effectively military strikes, then discussing them in media appearances. He confirmed in October that he had authorized CIA covert operations in Venezuela. Then he referenced specific strikes. Then he declined to specify whether the latest operation was CIA or military, while officials confirmed to reporters that it was indeed the agency.</p>\n\n<p>This is not covert action as the framework contemplates it. This is the use of intelligence authorities to accomplish military objectives while avoiding the restraints that apply to military operations.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Restraint</p>\n\n<p>When the military conducts strikes on foreign soil, certain mechanisms engage. The War Powers Resolution requires notification to Congress within 48 hours. The Authorization for Use of Military Force, however interpreted or abused, must be invoked. Military lawyers apply the law of armed conflict. Records are created. Chain of command is clear. Years later, historians can trace decisions.</p>\n\n<p>When the CIA acts covertly, different rules apply. The President must issue a formal \"finding\" under 50 U.S.C. § 3093. The Gang of Eight, leaders of the intelligence committees, must be notified. But the operations themselves remain classified. No public record exists. No debate occurs. The American people learn only what the administration chooses to disclose, if anything.</p>\n\n<p>The system assumes these will be different kinds of operations.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when they become the same operation, conducted under different authorities?</p>\n\n<p>That is not a hypothetical question. That is what we are watching.</p>\n\n<p>## The Venezuelan Escalation</p>\n\n<p>The administration has been conducting a months-long pressure campaign against Venezuela. It began with a Caribbean buildup in August. Thirty military strikes on alleged drug boats followed. Then came tanker seizures. Now, a strike on Venezuelan land, the first since this campaign began.</p>\n\n<p>Each step moves the line. Each step establishes a new baseline of normal. And by routing this latest strike through the CIA rather than Special Operations Command, the administration avoids certain reporting requirements that would apply to military action while still discussing the operation publicly enough to send a message.</p>\n\n<p>That message is heard in Caracas. But it should also be heard in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Maduro runs a criminal regime. He does. The question is not whether Venezuela poses challenges for U.S. interests. It does. The question is whether the President may conduct what amounts to a sustained military campaign using intelligence authorities to sidestep the mechanisms that Congress established to constrain executive war powers.</p>\n\n<p>I know what the answer is supposed to be. I am watching something different happen.</p>\n\n<p>## What Gets Normalized</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, Congress passed an AUMF targeting those responsible for 9/11. Three presidential administrations stretched that authorization to cover groups that did not exist in 2001, in countries Congress never mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>That expansion happened gradually. Each strike was justified by the one before. Each target was described as sufficiently connected to the original authorization. And over time, what was meant to be a specific response to a specific attack became a general grant of authority to strike threats wherever the executive identified them.</p>\n\n<p>We are watching a similar process with covert action authorities. What was meant for operations requiring deniability is being used for operations the President discusses on talk radio. What was meant for intelligence collection and limited paramilitary action is being used for sustained military campaigns. And what was meant to be subject to specific oversight is being routed through mechanisms that allow less scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>The CIA is not supposed to be a parallel military for hire. The intelligence committees are not supposed to substitute for the Armed Services Committees' oversight of military operations. And the President is not supposed to be able to wage war by choosing which statutory framework creates the least friction.</p>\n\n<p>But if you can achieve the same objective through intelligence authorities that you could through military action, and intelligence authorities require less notification, less documentation, and less public scrutiny, why would any president choose the more constrained path?</p>\n\n<p>The incentive structure now favors using covert action authorities for overt purposes.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question Congress Is Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>Congressional leaders were presumably briefed on this operation. The Gang of Eight was notified as required by law. But the rest of Congress, and the American people, know only what was publicly disclosed.</p>\n\n<p>That is the system working as designed for genuine covert action.</p>\n\n<p>It is not the system working as designed for sustained military pressure campaigns that the President discusses in media appearances.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what Congress should be asking: If the President is comfortable enough with an operation to reference it publicly, should that operation be conducted under authorities designed for actions that must remain secret?</p>\n\n<p>The covert action statute does not prohibit the President from later acknowledging operations. But it assumes that operations will generally remain classified, and that public acknowledgment will be the exception, not the pattern. It assumes that intelligence operations will be intelligence operations, not substitutes for military campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>When those assumptions break down, the statutory framework stops functioning as intended. The restraints Congress imposed become suggestions. And the difference between war powers subject to legislative oversight and executive action requiring only notification to eight members begins to collapse.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent</p>\n\n<p>This matters beyond Venezuela. It matters beyond this administration. Because what is established here will be available to every future president.</p>\n\n<p>If intelligence authorities can be used for sustained campaigns against nation-states, then the next president facing a crisis will remember that option. If operations can be discussed publicly while still remaining formally covert, then the distinction between acknowledged military action and deniable intelligence operations loses meaning. And if Congress accepts this expansion without clarifying the limits, then those limits effectively no longer exist.</p>\n\n<p>The tools we create for extraordinary circumstances become the tools we use for ordinary ones. The authorities we grant for this threat become the authorities invoked for the next. And the restraints we erode today are the restraints our children will wish existed when they inherit these powers in different hands.</p>\n\n<p>I have watched this process before. After 9/11, after the AUMF expansion, after drones became routine in Pakistan and Yemen and Somalia. Each time, the argument was that circumstances required flexibility. Each time, the promise was that authorities would be used responsibly. Each time, the expectation was that restraint would persist through norms if not through law.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, the restraints eroded anyway.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Constitution Anticipated</p>\n\n<p>Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the power to declare war. Article II makes the President Commander in Chief. The Founders created tension between those powers deliberately, believing that the decision to use force should require both branches to act.</p>\n\n<p>The intelligence apparatus was created later, after World War II, when the nature of conflict changed and new threats required new tools. But the fundamental structure remained: the decision to commit the nation to sustained military action should not rest with one person.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is the development of a workaround. If military action requires too much congressional involvement, use intelligence authorities instead. If the War Powers Resolution constrains one path, take another. If oversight is friction, choose the framework that generates less.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution's architecture of restraint only works if we maintain the distinction between different kinds of power. When those distinctions blur, when authorities meant for one purpose are used for another, the restraints fail.</p>\n\n<p>Not through defiance. Through adaptation.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Demand</p>\n\n<p>You do not need to oppose operations against drug traffickers to ask whether the legal framework governing those operations remains sound. You do not need to defend Maduro to ask whether the President should be able to wage undeclared war using intelligence authorities. You do not need to be a pacifist to believe that the decision to use force on foreign soil should be subject to meaningful democratic oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Those questions are not partisan. They are constitutional.</p>\n\n<p>If Congress believes the Venezuela campaign is justified, it should authorize it through military authorities. If the campaign requires secrecy, it should remain covert and unacknowledged. But the current approach, publicly discussed operations conducted through secret authorities, serves no legitimate purpose except to avoid the oversight mechanisms that would otherwise apply.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a constitutional republic should function. That is how restraints disappear while everyone is watching but no one is objecting.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether you support this operation. The test is whether you believe the next president, the one whose judgment you do not trust, should inherit these authorities in this form.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then the time to clarify the limits is now. Before the practice becomes precedent. Before the exception becomes the rule. Before temporary flexibility becomes permanent power.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders did not trust any individual with unconstrained war powers. They built a system that required Congress and the Executive to both participate in decisions to use force.

      "content": "<p>I spent years handling classified material. Not as a policy matter or a legal theory, but as someone who carried documents in locked cases, who understood that certain information, once disclosed, could cost lives. I learned that accountability isn't abstract. It's the difference between order and chaos, between a system that constrains power and one that merely justifies it.</p>\n\n<p>Jack Smith sat before the House Judiciary Committee on December 17th and made a statement that should be unremarkable but has become extraordinary: \"The Jan. 6 riot does not happen without Donald Trump.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not a political claim. This is prosecutorial judgment, offered under oath, about causation and culpability.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this moment significant is not what Smith said, but what happened next. The cases were abandoned. Not because the evidence failed. Not because a jury acquitted. Because the subject of the investigation won an election, and Justice Department policy prohibits indicting a sitting president.</p>\n\n<p>That policy is defensible. What is less defensible is what it reveals about how we now understand accountability.</p>\n\n<p>## The Prosecutor Who Could Not Prosecute</p>\n\n<p>Smith laid out his evidence in the deposition. He described Trump as \"the most culpable and most responsible person\" in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. He detailed how the case was built on testimony from Republicans who chose country over party, including a Pennsylvania elector who called the scheme \"an attempt to overthrow the government and illegal.\" He noted that Trump \"caused\" the Capitol attack, \"exploited it,\" and that it was \"foreseeable to him.\"</p>\n\n<p>He also described what Trump did while the violence unfolded: refused to stop it, issued a tweet that \"without question in my mind endangered the life of his own vice president,\" and had to be \"pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not hearsay. This is the assessment of a veteran prosecutor who reviewed the evidence, obtained cooperating witnesses, and presented the case to a grand jury that returned an indictment.</p>\n\n<p>Then Trump won the election. The cases ended.</p>\n\n<p>Not because the facts changed. Because the defendant's status changed.</p>\n\n<p>## What Has Quietly Shifted</p>\n\n<p>The principle that a sitting president cannot be indicted is longstanding. It rests on the idea that prosecuting a president while in office would interfere with the executive function. The remedy for presidential misconduct, in this framework, is impeachment, not indictment.</p>\n\n<p>But impeachment requires political will. It requires a Congress willing to place constitutional duty above partisan loyalty. What happens when that will does not exist? What happens when impeachment becomes a partisan exercise, acquittal a foregone conclusion, and the only remaining check is criminal prosecution after leaving office?</p>\n\n<p>What happens when a person can avoid that prosecution by winning another election?</p>\n\n<p>We are watching the collapse of the distinction between legal immunity and practical impunity.</p>\n\n<p>Legal immunity is temporary and bounded. It says: while you hold this office, you cannot be indicted, but you remain accountable through impeachment, and you remain subject to prosecution once you leave.</p>\n\n<p>Practical impunity is different. It says: if you can stay in power long enough, or regain power quickly enough, the law cannot reach you. The clock runs out. The cases are dismissed. The evidence is preserved in a transcript that becomes a historical footnote, not a judicial verdict.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Are Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>Smith was asked during his deposition whether his investigations were meant to prevent Trump from reclaiming the presidency. He bristled at the question, and rightly so. Prosecutors investigate crimes. Grand juries return indictments when they find probable cause. The timing of an investigation does not negate the validity of the charges.</p>\n\n<p>But here is the question we should be asking: What does it mean for the rule of law when the most serious charges against a former president can be nullified not by exoneration, but by election?</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Trump. This is about precedent.</p>\n\n<p>If a president can commit acts that a special counsel describes as criminal, if those acts can be detailed in an indictment, if cooperating witnesses can be found, if a grand jury can return charges, and if all of that can be rendered moot by winning another election, then we have created a new constitutional reality.</p>\n\n<p>We have created a category of person who is, in effect, above the law not because the law exempts them, but because the mechanisms of accountability have become too slow, too political, too easily gamed.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Founders Feared</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 that impeachment was the remedy for \"offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\" He understood that such offenses were \"political\" in nature, meaning they related to the conduct of the state and the duties of office.</p>\n\n<p>But Hamilton also understood the danger of leaving such matters entirely to political bodies. He knew that \"the division of the government into distinct and separate departments\" was meant to prevent the concentration of power, and that each branch was meant to check the others.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when one branch will not check, and another cannot prosecute?</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned in Federalist No. 51 that \"ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\" The system depends on each branch defending its prerogatives, on institutional jealousy preventing the accumulation of unchecked power.</p>\n\n<p>But what happens when ambition does not counteract ambition? What happens when one party controls both the executive and the legislative branch, and regards accountability as disloyalty?</p>\n\n<p>The system bends. The lines move. What was once extraordinary becomes routine.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing that Trump should have been convicted. I am not arguing that the evidence was dispositive, or that a jury would have reached a particular verdict. Those are questions for a courtroom, and we will never know the answers because the cases did not proceed.</p>\n\n<p>What I am arguing is this: We are normalizing a system in which the most serious allegations against a president can be investigated, indicted, and then abandoned not because they were disproven, but because the calendar ran out.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the rule of law. That is the rule of timing.</p>\n\n<p>Smith's testimony will be read by historians. It will be cited in law review articles. It may even be taught in classrooms as an example of prosecutorial judgment in politically charged cases. But it will not result in a verdict, because the defendant became unreachable.</p>\n\n<p>Is this compatible with a free society? Is this what the Founders intended when they created a system of checks and balances?</p>\n\n<p>Those questions, unanswered, define the test we face. Not whether Trump is guilty or innocent, but whether the system can hold anyone accountable when accountability depends on speed, on political will, and on an electorate that may or may not care.</p>\n\n<p>That test is here.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Taiwan's president stood before cameras after China's latest military drills and pledged to defend the island's sovereignty. The statement was expected. The drills were expected. The international response was expected.</p>\n\n<p>That's the problem.</p>\n\n<p>We have normalized what should be extraordinary. Large-scale military exercises encircling a democratic society of 23 million people have become routine enough that they merit brief news coverage before we move to the next story. The question isn't whether Taiwan's president will defend sovereignty. The question is whether the international order still recognizes sovereignty as something more than a performance.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in government watching how power moves when no one is watching the seams. You learn that the most dangerous shifts aren't sudden. They're incremental. They're the drills that happen every few months until they're happening every few weeks. They're the intrusions that cross a line until that line becomes the new baseline.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Taiwan alone. This is about whether territorial integrity means anything when backed only by statements rather than structure.</p>\n\n<p>**The Erosion We're Witnessing**</p>\n\n<p>The drills China conducts around Taiwan follow a pattern anyone who has studied military operations recognizes: normalization through repetition. Each exercise pushes slightly further. Each one lasts slightly longer. Each one involves slightly more sophisticated capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The goal isn't invasion today. The goal is making the possibility of invasion so routine that when it happens, the world responds with the same measured statements it's been issuing for years.</p>\n\n<p>This is how lines move. Not through dramatic declarations but through patient pressure.</p>\n\n<p>The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 commits the United States to provide Taiwan with defense articles and services. It states that any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than peaceful means would be \"of grave concern.\" But grave concern has become the international community's standard response to nearly everything. The phrase has been depleted of meaning through overuse.</p>\n\n<p>What we're watching is the slow strangulation of a principle—that borders cannot be changed by force—through the patient application of force that stops just short of war.</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Guarantees**</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan operates under strategic ambiguity. The United States has not explicitly guaranteed its defense. This ambiguity was meant to deter both Chinese aggression and Taiwanese declarations of formal independence. It was meant to preserve stability.</p>\n\n<p>But ambiguity only works when all parties believe certain lines still matter. When those lines are tested repeatedly without consequence, ambiguity becomes indistinguishability. It becomes unclear whether commitments exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>I've sat in rooms where officials debate what level of action would trigger response. The debates are earnest. The analysis is sophisticated. But the underlying question is never quite asked: At what point does our failure to enforce principles mean we no longer hold those principles?</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood that power respects nothing but power. Hamilton wrote in Federalist 34 that nations must have \"an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they might arise.\" But he was writing about a nation's capacity to defend itself, not the international community's capacity to defend abstract principles while avoiding risk.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan can pledge to defend its sovereignty. That pledge means nothing without the capacity to make good on it, and small democracies facing large authoritarian neighbors rarely possess that capacity alone.</p>\n\n<p>**What Sovereignty Means**</p>\n\n<p>Sovereignty isn't a statement. It's a fact pattern. It's functioning institutions, territorial control, international recognition, and the capacity to defend all three. Taiwan has the first three. The fourth is what's being tested.</p>\n\n<p>The People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan. Not for a day. Taiwan has its own constitution, its own military, its own currency, its own democratically elected government. By any functional measure, Taiwan is sovereign.</p>\n\n<p>But sovereignty without security is sovereignty on loan. It lasts until someone stronger decides it shouldn't.</p>\n\n<p>This is the test we're failing to acknowledge. The question isn't whether Taiwan will defend itself. The question is whether the international order still believes that territorial integrity matters enough to impose costs on those who violate it before the violation is complete.</p>\n\n<p>**The Pattern We've Seen Before**</p>\n\n<p>Crimea was sovereign Ukrainian territory until Russian troops arrived and it wasn't. The international community condemned the action, imposed sanctions, and moved on. Crimea is still occupied.</p>\n\n<p>Georgia's breakaway regions were sovereign Georgian territory until Russian recognition and military support made them independent in everything but international law. The world objected. The regions remain separated.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is consistent: Test boundaries, face condemnation, absorb sanctions, retain gains. The cost-benefit analysis favors aggression when the costs are temporary and the benefits are permanent.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan sees this. That's why its president must pledge to defend sovereignty rather than assume it. That's why the island spends over two percent of GDP on defense despite having an economy built on trade and technology, not military power. That's why every military drill from Beijing sends not just a message but a measurement: How much will they prepare? How much will their partners commit?</p>\n\n<p>**The American Question**</p>\n\n<p>The United States faces a version of the question the Founders debated: How do you preserve liberty against power without becoming the thing you oppose? How do you maintain order without maintaining empire?</p>\n\n<p>We have interests in Taiwan's continued autonomy. Economic interests—the island produces the advanced semiconductors that run modern economies. Strategic interests—Taiwan sits at a geographic chokepoint for Pacific trade. Moral interests—23 million people living in a democracy should not be absorbed into an authoritarian state against their will.</p>\n\n<p>But interests are not commitments, and in the ambiguity between the two, Taiwan lives in permanent uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know whether the United States should explicitly guarantee Taiwan's defense. That decision involves calculations above my rank. But I know what happens when commitments are ambiguous and adversaries are patient. I know what happens when we treat sovereignty as a principle we honor in rhetoric but not in risk.</p>\n\n<p>We get more drills. More intrusions. More normalization of what should be extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Until one day it isn't a drill.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question we're not asking is this: What makes sovereignty real?</p>\n\n<p>Is it international recognition? Taiwan doesn't have that—most nations maintain only informal ties to avoid angering Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>Is it functional independence? Taiwan has that, but function without security is temporary.</p>\n\n<p>Is it the will to defend? Taiwan has that too, but will without capacity is performance.</p>\n\n<p>Is it external guarantees? Taiwan has strategic ambiguity, which might mean support or might mean statements.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is probably all of the above, functioning together. Remove any piece and the structure weakens. Remove enough pieces and sovereignty becomes something leaders pledge to defend because it can no longer be assumed.</p>\n\n<p>That's where Taiwan is. That's where we've let it arrive through incremental acceptance of what should be unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>When military drills encircling a democracy become routine. When we measure our response in careful statements rather than committed action. When sovereignty requires daily defense rather than assumed respect.</p>\n\n<p>We're not just failing Taiwan. We're failing the principle that borders exist, that territorial integrity matters, that might doesn't make right when right has no might behind it.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't in Taiwan's pledge to defend its sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>The test is whether the rest of us still believe sovereignty means anything worth defending.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in places where coalitions held together not from shared principles but from shared enemies. When the enemy recedes, the coalition's real nature becomes visible. What happens next tests whether the arrangement was ever about governance or merely about power.</p>\n\n<p>Yemen is teaching that lesson again.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern We've Seen Before</p>\n\n<p>The Southern Transitional Council announced a constitution for an independent South Yemen on January 2, 2026. That's not a declaration of independence in the way Americans understand the term—not a statement of grievances followed by an assertion of natural rights. It's a unilateral claim to authority backed by force, announced while Saudi warplanes strike STC positions and UAE support flows to the separatists.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't governance. This is partition by violence under the rhetoric of self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>The international community has spent a decade pretending the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen was unified in purpose: restore the internationally recognized government, defeat the Iranian-backed Houthis, stabilize the country. That coalition is now bombing itself. Saudi Arabia strikes UAE-backed forces. The government it claimed to restore has fled to Riyadh. The Presidential Palace in Aden, which coalition forces supposedly secured, is controlled by separatists who reject that government's authority entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The pretense has collapsed.</p>\n\n<p>## What a Constitution Actually Requires</p>\n\n<p>The STC calls its document a \"constitution.\" It has 30 articles. It proclaims \"the State of South Arabia.\" It promises a referendum in two years on self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>But a constitution is not merely a document asserting authority. It is a framework that derives legitimacy from the consent of the governed, implemented through processes that create accountability rather than merely consolidating control.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison, in Federalist 51, wrote that \"the structure of the government must furnish the proper checks and balances between the different departments.\" The STC's \"constitution\" appears to furnish nothing but an assertion of territorial control by forces that seized two provinces by arms last month and now demand other factions accept their claim.</p>\n\n<p>That's not constitutionalism. That's conquest with paperwork.</p>\n\n<p>The test of a constitutional order is whether it constrains power or merely justifies it. Whether it creates mechanisms for peaceful resolution of disputes or demands submission under threat of force. Whether temporary authority remains temporary or becomes permanent through the logic of emergency.</p>\n\n<p>The STC's \"constitution\" appears designed to do the opposite: to present a unilateral seizure of territory as a legitimate constitutional act, to frame military control as self-determination, to make provisional what should require deliberation and consent.</p>\n\n<p>## When Imposed Order Reveals Its Nature</p>\n\n<p>For ten years, the international community treated the Saudi-led coalition as a legitimate governing authority in Yemen. The United States provided intelligence, refueling, targeting assistance. The coalition's intervention was framed as restoring order, protecting regional stability, countering Iranian expansion.</p>\n\n<p>That intervention has killed tens of thousands of civilians. It has produced what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. It has destroyed infrastructure, blockaded ports, and created conditions for famine and disease. And now the coalition that justified all of this as necessary for Yemen's stability is fracturing into open conflict between its major backers.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an aberration. This is the nature of imposed order revealing itself when the justifying emergency no longer holds the arrangement together.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia now bombs positions it once funded. The UAE supports forces that reject the government it once claimed to restore. Forces that fought together against the Houthis now fight each other for control of the south. The internationally recognized government exists in exile, recognized internationally but governing nothing.</p>\n\n<p>And through it all, the Houthis still control the north.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson isn't that intervention always fails. The lesson is that intervention justified by temporary emergency tends to become permanent, that coalitions built on shared enemies rather than shared principles fracture when the enemy recedes, and that the pretense of legitimacy eventually collapses under the weight of what was done in its name.</p>\n\n<p>## The Questions Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>When a faction announces a constitution while under bombardment by its former allies, several questions become relevant:</p>\n\n<p>Was the coalition ever about the principles it claimed, or was it always about competing regional powers using Yemen as a proxy battlefield?</p>\n\n<p>If the internationally recognized government was the coalition's goal, why does that government now exist only in exile while coalition members fight each other for control?</p>\n\n<p>If stability was the objective, what has been achieved after ten years of intervention except the fragmentation of the country into competing spheres of influence, each backed by a different external power?</p>\n\n<p>If humanitarian protection justified the intervention, how do we account for the humanitarian catastrophe the intervention produced?</p>\n\n<p>And most importantly: when does temporary authority imposed by emergency become indistinguishable from permanent rule justified by necessity?</p>\n\n<p>These questions matter beyond Yemen. They matter every time intervention is justified by temporary emergency, every time coalition unity is asserted without examining what holds it together, every time constitutional language is deployed to legitimize what force has already decided.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Reveals About Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>The STC's \"constitution\" will likely be dismissed by the international community as illegitimate because it was announced unilaterally, without consultation, backed by force rather than consent. That dismissal will be correct.</p>\n\n<p>But the same standard should apply to the arrangement that preceded it: a coalition justified by restoring a government that never controlled the territory it claimed, backed by powers whose actual interests diverged from their stated principles, maintained through a decade of violence that achieved none of its stated objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy cannot be asserted by proclamation, whether that proclamation comes from separatists announcing a constitution or from coalitions announcing their mission is stability while bombing hospitals.</p>\n\n<p>Legitimacy requires consent, accountability, mechanisms for peaceful change, and limits on power that bind those who wield it. The STC's document appears to provide none of those. Neither did the arrangement it seeks to replace.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a justification for the STC's actions. It's an observation about what happens when temporary authority imposed by force becomes the normal condition, when constitutional language is used to justify what violence has decided, when the test of legitimacy becomes which faction the international community chooses to recognize rather than whether any party has demonstrated accountability to the people they claim to govern.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test That Remains</p>\n\n<p>Yemen's fracture is not unique. It follows a pattern visible in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan—places where intervention was justified by temporary emergency, where imposed order was presented as necessary for stability, where coalitions held together through shared enemies rather than shared principles.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, the pretense eventually collapsed. The emergency never ended. The temporary authority became permanent. The coalition fractured. And the people who lived there paid the price for arrangements made in their name by powers whose interests lay elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The test isn't whether to intervene. The test is whether intervention creates or merely displaces violence, whether temporary authority remains temporary or becomes permanent, whether constitutional forms constrain power or merely justify it.</p>\n\n<p>Yemen is failing that test. Again.</p>\n\n<p>The question American citizens should ask is not which faction to support in Yemen's civil war. The question is whether the pattern that produced this outcome—intervention justified by temporary emergency, coalition unity asserted without examining what sustains it, constitutional language deployed to legitimize what force decides—is compatible with the principles we claim to hold.</p>\n\n<p>Not just in Yemen.</p>\n\n<p>Everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered honestly, is why this still matters.</p>",

It is not even regime change in the post-9/11 sense.</p>\n\n<p>It is direct administration of foreign territory by executive decree.</p>\n\n<p>## What Authority, Exactly?</p>\n\n<p>The Chevron license to operate in Venezuela was granted by the Biden administration in 2022 under existing sanctions law. It required Treasury Department approval, State Department coordination, and operated within a legal framework established over years of congressional and executive action.</p>\n\n<p>That is how the system is supposed to work. Incrementally. With legal predicates. With checks.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have moved from \"American companies may operate in Venezuela under license\" to \"American companies will run Venezuela's oil infrastructure and the United States will run the country.\"</p>\n\n<p>What statute authorizes this? What appropriation funds it? What congressional resolution blesses it? What body of international law permits one nation to announce it will \"run\" another?</p>\n\n<p>The answer appears to be: none.</p>\n\n<p>The authority is presidential will. The justification is that Maduro was a dictator and his successor is not yet in place. The mechanism is announcement.</p>\n\n<p>This is how extraordinary measures become normalized. Not through dramatic constitutional crisis. Through vocabulary that slips past the ear. Through policy declared rather than debated. Through the quiet substitution of executive decree for legal process.</p>\n\n<p>## The Decade We Are Not Discussing</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela's oil infrastructure, we are told, will take tens of billions of dollars and potentially a decade to restore. Even former BP executives acknowledge that output might actually fall during reorganization. The former chief executive of BP called it \"a very long term project.\"</p>\n\n<p>A decade is longer than World War II lasted. A decade is longer than the initial reconstruction of Japan under MacArthur. A decade is longer than the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the entirety of the Johnson administration combined.</p>\n\n<p>If we are going to \"run\" Venezuela for a decade, what does that mean?</p>\n\n<p>Who governs? Under what legal authority? With what accountability to Congress, to international law, to the Venezuelan people themselves? Who pays? For how long? With what recourse if companies expropriate assets, if corruption persists, if the \"safe transition\" never materializes?</p>\n\n<p>These are not rhetorical questions. They are constitutional requirements.</p>\n\n<p>When the United States occupied Japan and Germany after World War II, it did so under military authority following declared war, unconditional surrender, and explicit congressional appropriations for reconstruction. The occupation had defined legal status, multilateral oversight, and clear end conditions.</p>\n\n<p>When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, Congress authorized military force. A Coalition Provisional Authority was established by executive order with defined powers and duration. When that authority transferred to Iraqi sovereignty in 2004, it did so under UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements.</p>\n\n<p>Those precedents had problems. They generated controversy. They cost blood and treasure. But they operated within some framework of law.</p>\n\n<p>What framework applies here?</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>American oil companies may well be reluctant to invest tens of billions in a country whose government expropriated ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips assets in the 2000s. They may well doubt the stability of whatever government emerges. They may well calculate that the risk exceeds the reward, no matter how large the proven reserves.</p>\n\n<p>But the deeper question is not whether they will invest. The deeper question is under what authority they would be operating if they do.</p>\n\n<p>If Venezuela's successor government invites American companies to develop oil infrastructure under negotiated contracts, that is sovereignty in action. That is how nations rebuild after dictatorship. It may succeed or fail based on the terms negotiated, the governance established, the trust rebuilt.</p>\n\n<p>If American companies operate under the authority of the United States government while the United States government \"runs\" Venezuela, that is something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>That is a trust territory without treaty. An occupation without declaration. A protectorate without legal standing.</p>\n\n<p>The word for that used to be \"colony.\"</p>\n\n<p>## The Principle at Stake</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing that America should abandon Venezuela to chaos. I am not arguing that Maduro's removal was unjust. I am not arguing that Venezuelan oil should never flow again.</p>\n\n<p>I am arguing that the process matters. That the authority matters. That the difference between \"we will help Venezuela rebuild\" and \"we will run Venezuela\" is not semantic.</p>\n\n<p>It is constitutional.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned in Federalist No. 41: \"The powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as little formidable to those reserved to the individual States, as they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Union.\" The same principle applies to executive power in foreign affairs. The authority must be proportional, defined, and accountable.</p>\n\n<p>When a president can announce that America will \"run\" another country without congressional authorization, without legal framework, without defined limits or end conditions, we have moved beyond the constitutional order that constrains power.</p>\n\n<p>We have moved into something else.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Normalizes</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time extraordinary executive authority has been asserted in foreign affairs. It will not be the last. But each instance that passes without constitutional check becomes precedent for the next.</p>\n\n<p>If we can \"run\" Venezuela by executive decree, can we \"run\" Haiti? Cuba? Any nation where crisis offers opportunity and oil offers incentive?</p>\n\n<p>The principle, once established, does not limit itself to convenient cases.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War and later wrote: \"Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?\" He was arguing that extreme crisis justified extreme measures. But he was also acknowledging that those measures were violations. That they required justification beyond presidential will.</p>\n\n<p>That distinction, between emergency action later justified and permanent authority casually claimed, is what this moment is erasing.</p>\n\n<p>The United States will \"run\" Venezuela. The statement was made. No law was cited. No constitutional mechanism engaged. No congressional debate held. No treaty signed.</p>\n\n<p>Just policy. By announcement.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether that is compatible with a republic.</p>\n\n<p>Not whether it is expedient. Not whether it might work. Not whether Maduro deserved removal.</p>\n\n<p>Whether a president announcing that America will \"run\" another sovereign nation, for however long it takes, under whatever authority he asserts, is the kind of power the Constitution permits.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years carrying a security clearance. I briefed alliance partners. I knew what NATO Article 5 meant, what mutual defense obligations looked like on paper and in practice.</p>\n\n<p>So I know what it means when the President of the United States publicly discusses annexing the territory of a NATO ally.</p>\n\n<p>It means something has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Greenland's strategic value. The United States already has substantial military access to Greenland under existing agreements with Denmark. Thule Air Base has operated there since 1951. We have what we need for national security through lawful cooperation with a democratic ally.</p>\n\n<p>This is about something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>## The Language of Acquisition</p>\n\n<p>Listen to the words being used. Not \"negotiate,\" not \"partner,\" not \"cooperate.\"</p>\n\n<p>Annex.</p>\n\n<p>That's the language of territorial conquest. That's what Russia said about Crimea in 2014. That's what imperial powers said in the 19th century when they drew lines on maps and called it diplomacy.</p>\n\n<p>The President has \"refused to rule out\" using force. A senior aide's spouse posts a map of Greenland colored as an American flag with the caption \"SOON.\" The administration appoints a special envoy to Greenland, bypassing Denmark's foreign ministry entirely.</p>\n\n<p>These are not normal diplomatic overtures. These are the actions of a power that sees sovereignty as conditional, treaties as suggestions, and allied territory as potentially available.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark's Prime Minister had to remind the United States that they are covered by NATO's security guarantee. Think about that sentence. A NATO ally had to publicly invoke Article 5, not against an external threat, but as a warning to the United States itself.</p>\n\n<p>## The Precedent Being Set</p>\n\n<p>This comes days after a military operation that seized Venezuela's president. The President then announced the United States would \"run\" Venezuela and that American oil companies would \"start making money for the country.\"</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is clear. What is being normalized is the idea that American power can simply override sovereignty when we determine we have strategic interests.</p>\n\n<p>Greenland has mineral wealth we want. It has strategic position we value. Therefore, the logic goes, we should control it.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that 57,000 people live there, that they have their own government, that they overwhelmingly oppose becoming American territory, that they are citizens of a democratic nation with which we have treaty obligations, these are treated as obstacles, not as fundamental realities that define the limits of legitimate action.</p>\n\n<p>I remember when we used to criticize other nations for thinking this way.</p>\n\n<p>## What Alliances Mean</p>\n\n<p>I deployed alongside NATO partners. I saw what mutual defense looks like when it's real. It means you don't covet your ally's territory. It means you don't publicly discuss annexing land that belongs to a democratic partner. It means you don't send signals that their sovereignty is negotiable if we decide we want what they have.</p>\n\n<p>Article 5 of the NATO Treaty states that an armed attack against one member \"shall be considered an attack against them all.\" We invoked that article once, after September 11th. NATO allies deployed to Afghanistan. Danish soldiers died there, alongside Americans, under that mutual defense obligation.</p>\n\n<p>Now their Prime Minister has to publicly state that Denmark expects respect for its territorial integrity. From us.</p>\n\n<p>If American territorial ambitions can override the sovereignty of a NATO ally, what does NATO mean? If our security interests justify annexation, what principle restrains any other power from making the same claim?</p>\n\n<p>The answer being offered is: American power restrains other powers. We can do what they cannot because we are stronger.</p>\n\n<p>That's not an alliance system. That's a protection racket.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war and to regulate relations with foreign nations. The President commands the military, but does not possess inherent authority to annex foreign territory or override treaty obligations.</p>\n\n<p>Yet we are watching this play out as if it were purely an executive matter. No congressional authorization is being sought. No debate about whether acquiring Greenland, by whatever means, serves the national interest or comports with our treaty obligations.</p>\n\n<p>The assumption is that if the President wants it, if he can describe a security rationale, then the question is merely tactical: how, not whether.</p>\n\n<p>This is how executive power expands. Not through formal amendment, but through the gradual acceptance that some objectives, if deemed important enough, simply happen outside the normal constitutional process.</p>\n\n<p>First, we accept that national security justifies extraordinary action.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we accept that the President defines what national security requires.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we accept that allies' sovereignty is subordinate to our security needs.</p>\n\n<p>At no point does Congress formally cede this authority. It simply fails to assert it.</p>\n\n<p>## What History Shows</p>\n\n<p>In 1846, the United States went to war with Mexico, seized vast territory, and later paid $15 million in what was framed as a purchase but followed military conquest. That expansion was contentious even then. Abraham Lincoln, then a congressman, challenged President Polk to identify the exact spot where American blood had been shed to justify the war.</p>\n\n<p>The question Lincoln was asking was whether the conflict served legitimate defense or disguised territorial ambition.</p>\n\n<p>We should ask that question now. Does the United States face a genuine security threat that existing agreements with Denmark cannot address? Or are we describing ambition as necessity?</p>\n\n<p>Greenland's people have the same right to self-determination that we claimed in 1776. They are not resources to be acquired. They are citizens of a democratic nation, entitled to decide their own future.</p>\n\n<p>When we stop recognizing that, when we start speaking of allied territory as something we \"need\" and therefore might take, we have left behind the principles that made us different from the empires we once opposed.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test of Principle</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether Greenland has strategic value. It does.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether the Arctic matters. It does.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether we recognize limits to our power, whether we honor treaty obligations, whether we respect the sovereignty of democratic allies, and whether the Constitution constrains how we pursue even legitimate interests.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the answer emerging is that when the President invokes national security, those constraints fade.</p>\n\n<p>No treaty is absolute. No sovereignty is secure. No alliance removes American territory from consideration if we decide we want it.</p>\n\n<p>That's not American exceptionalism. That's just imperialism with better public relations.</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. So did the President. That oath doesn't include an exception for strategically located islands. It doesn't authorize annexing allied territory because we've decided it serves our interests.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether Greenland matters strategically.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the law still restrains us when we want something.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, watching this unfold, I'm not sure we know the answer anymore.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I never imagined that oath might require defending our NATO allies from us.</p>\n\n<p>The White House has confirmed that the President is considering military options to acquire Greenland, a territory of Denmark. Denmark is not an adversary. Denmark is a NATO ally. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. We wrote that treaty. We founded that alliance. Now we are discussing whether to use military force against a member state.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Greenland's strategic value. It's about what we're willing to become.</p>\n\n<p>The language matters. The White House called acquiring Greenland \"a national security priority\" and confirmed that \"utilizing the US military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal.\" The phrasing is precise. It does not say the military is an option if Greenland becomes a threat. It says the military is an option to pursue what we want.</p>\n\n<p>That's not defense. That's conquest.</p>\n\n<p>A senior adviser to the President, when asked if force would be ruled out, replied: \"Nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\" Think about what that sentence assumes. It assumes that superior military power justifies territorial ambition. It assumes that might makes right. It assumes that an ally's refusal to sell its territory is irrelevant if we decide we need it.</p>\n\n<p>Every autocrat in history has made that calculation.</p>\n\n<p>## The Treaty We Signed</p>\n\n<p>Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution grants the President power to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate. The North Atlantic Treaty was ratified by the Senate on July 21, 1949, by a vote of 82 to 13. It entered into force on August 24, 1949. It is binding law under Article VI of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>Article 1 of the North Atlantic Treaty commits signatories to \"settle any international dispute in which they may be involved by peaceful means\" and to \"refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force.\"</p>\n\n<p>Article 5 states: \"The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.\"</p>\n\n<p>Denmark is a party to that treaty. So are we. The treaty does not contain an exception for when we decide we want something. It does not say that Article 5 applies only when convenient. It says an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>\n\n<p>If we use military force against Denmark, we violate the treaty we signed. We commit the armed attack that Article 5 was written to prevent. We become the threat NATO was created to counter.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark's Prime Minister stated that an American attack would spell the end of NATO. She is not exaggerating. If the guarantor of collective defense becomes the aggressor, the alliance ceases to exist. Not formally, perhaps. But functionally. What ally will trust Article 5 if we demonstrate that our word is conditional on our ambitions?</p>\n\n<p>## The People Being Claimed</p>\n\n<p>Greenland is not empty land. It is home to 57,000 people, the majority of them Indigenous Greenlanders, the Kalaallit. The territory has had self-government since 1979. Opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Morgan Angaju, an Inuit from Ilulissat, told reporters it is \"terrifying to listen to the leader of the free world laughing at Denmark and Greenland and just talking about us like we're something to claim.\" He added: \"We are already claimed by the Greenlandic people. Kalaallit Nunaat means the land of the Greenlandic people.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Greenlanders are not asking to join us. They are protesting the idea. A thousand of them marched in March 2025 carrying signs reading \"Kalaallit don't want to be annexed\" and \"Greenland belongs to Inuit.\" They are not consulted in this \"national security priority.\" They are referred to as if they are incidental to the real estate.</p>\n\n<p>This is not negotiation. This is discussing the future of a people without their consent.</p>\n\n<p>The Declaration of Independence states that governments derive \"their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" Lincoln, in his First Inaugural Address, said: \"No state, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union, that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\"</p>\n\n<p>He was speaking of secession, but the principle holds. A government cannot simply seize territory and impose its authority because it declares that doing so serves its interests. The people living there have a claim. International law recognizes this. The UN Charter, which the United States signed and the Senate ratified, upholds \"the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.\"</p>\n\n<p>Seven European nations issued a joint statement affirming that \"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations.\" That principle is not a diplomatic nicety. It is the foundation of the international order we built after World War II to prevent exactly this kind of territorial ambition.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization of Force</p>\n\n<p>What alarms me most is the casual tone. The White House statement was matter-of-fact. The senior adviser was dismissive. There was no acknowledgment that what is being discussed, military action against an ally over territory it will not sell, is extraordinary. It was framed as ordinary. As an option on the table. As something within normal bounds.</p>\n\n<p>This is how norms collapse. Not with a sudden rupture, but with a steady redefinition of what is reasonable. If using military force to acquire the territory of an ally can be publicly discussed by the White House as an option under consideration, then the line has already moved. What was unthinkable is now thinkable. What was beyond the pale is now a policy choice.</p>\n\n<p>We saw this pattern before. Extraordinary rendition, once exposed, was defended as necessary. Enhanced interrogation, once revealed, was justified as effective. Drone strikes in nations we are not at war with, once controversial, became routine. Each time, the argument was: the threat is real, the stakes are high, the President has the authority, the critics don't understand the danger.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, temporary measures became permanent. Each time, legal boundaries were reinterpreted. Each time, what had been forbidden became policy.</p>\n\n<p>The framing of Greenland as a national security priority follows that pattern. It is not presented as a desire or an ambition. It is presented as a necessity. Once something is framed as necessary for national security, dissent becomes suspect. Legal constraints become obstacles. Allied objections become irritants.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Greenland has strategic value. The question is whether that value justifies what we are willing to do to obtain it.</p>\n\n<p>## What Comes Next</p>\n\n<p>I keep thinking about Morgan Angaju's fear that Greenland's prime minister might \"suffer the same fate as Maduro.\" That fear is not paranoia. It is a reasonable inference from the facts. The U.S. military seized the president of Venezuela, a sovereign nation, and brought him to the United States to face criminal charges. Days later, a senior White House adviser posted a map of Greenland with the American flag and the word \"SOON.\"</p>\n\n<p>The message is clear. If we want something, and you do not give it to us, we will take it. The method may vary. Economic pressure. Political coercion. Military force. But the result is the same.</p>\n\n<p>This is not how republics behave. This is how empires behave.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war. It does not grant the President the power to declare territorial ambitions and pursue them by any means necessary. The Founders were explicit about this. They had seen monarchy. They had seen executives who treated their own judgment as law. They designed a system where the decision to commit the nation to violence required the consent of the people's representatives.</p>\n\n<p>That constraint exists for a reason. It exists because power, unchecked, expands. It exists because one person's certainty is dangerous. It exists because what seems necessary in the moment may prove catastrophic in hindsight.</p>\n\n<p>## What We Are Testing</p>\n\n<p>NATO has endured for 76 years because its members believed that collective defense was real. That if one was attacked, the others would respond. That the United States, as the alliance's most powerful member, would honor its commitments even when inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>If we violate that trust, if we demonstrate that our commitments are conditional on our desires, we do not merely weaken NATO. We eliminate the foundation of any alliance. Why would any nation trust our word if we are willing to use force against those we pledged to defend?</p>\n\n<p>The argument that \"nobody's going to fight the US\" is not reassuring. It is chilling. It suggests that the limiting principle on our actions is not law, not treaty, not principle, but merely whether others can resist us. That is the logic of domination, not of leadership.</p>\n\n<p>I served because I believed in something. I believed that we defended a constitutional order, that we honored treaties, that we respected the sovereignty of nations and the dignity of peoples. I believed that our power was legitimate because it was bounded by law.</p>\n\n<p>If we use military force to acquire Greenland, what do we become?</p>\n\n<p>Not a republic. An empire that calls itself one.</p>\n\n<p>Not an alliance leader. A hegemon that demands submission.</p>\n\n<p>Not a constitutional democracy. A system where executive ambition defines national interest and military force is merely an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal.</p>\n\n<p>The Greenlanders do not want this. The Danes do not want this. Our European allies have explicitly opposed this. The question is whether what we want overrides all of that.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is what defines this moment.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

Maritime safety standards. Aviation protocols. Disease surveillance networks. The kind of cooperation that keeps planes from colliding and pandemics from spreading undetected.</p>\n\n<p>Most Americans never think about these organizations. They exist in that vast architecture of international order built after 1945, when the United States decided that leading meant building systems, not just wielding power.</p>\n\n<p>Now we are withdrawing from sixty-six of them.</p>\n\n<p>Not renegotiating. Not reforming. Withdrawing.</p>\n\n<p>The executive order describes these bodies as \"redundant,\" \"mismanaged,\" \"captured by actors advancing agendas contrary to our own.\" It calls them threats to \"sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.\" The language is sweeping. The specifics matter less than the principle being asserted: that participation in international cooperation is now conditional on moment-to-moment alignment with executive preferences.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about saving money.

These organizations operate through voluntary cooperation on technical standards.</p>\n\n<p>This is about something else.</p>\n\n<p>What we are watching is the conversion of leadership into transaction. America participates when it serves immediate interests, withdraws when it doesn't.

They built a constitution that channeled authority through institutions, constrained it with procedures, made it predictable enough that other nations could deal with us as a republic of laws rather than a collection of temporary preferences.</p>\n\n<p>That principle extended outward after 1945. The international order we built, however imperfect, rested on American participation in forums where we didn't always get our way. The World Trade Organization. The International Monetary Fund. The United Nations itself. These weren't acts of charity. They were instruments of American leadership, ways of shaping global outcomes through systems rather than serial confrontations.</p>\n\n<p>Withdrawing doesn't make America sovereign. We were already sovereign. It makes America unpredictable. It signals that our participation in any international forum is provisional, subject to executive whim, liable to change with each administration.</p>\n\n<p>Other nations will draw conclusions. They will build systems that don't depend on American participation. They will make agreements that exclude us. They will solve problems without us, because they cannot count on us.</p>\n\n<p>That's not sovereignty. That's abdication.</p>\n\n<p>## What Gets Normalized</p>\n\n<p>The executive order frames withdrawal as housekeeping. These organizations are \"redundant,\" \"poorly run,\" aligned with \"woke\" agendas. The language makes it sound like budget cutting, efficiency, common sense.</p>\n\n<p>But look at what's on the list. The International Cotton Advisory Committee. The International Tropical Timber Organization. The Pan-American Institute for Geography and History. These are technical bodies. They coordinate standards, share data, prevent conflicts before they start.</p>\n\n<p>Withdrawing from them doesn't protect American sovereignty. It eliminates American influence in the forums where standards get set. When we're not at the table, others make the rules. When we withdraw from the International Telecommunications Union, China fills the space. When we leave the International Maritime Organization, shipping standards get written without American input.</p>\n\n<p>The deeper pattern is this: expertise is being treated as optional. The people who run these organizations, who understand their functions, who know what will break when we leave, they're not being consulted. The withdrawal is categorical, ideological, comprehensive.</p>\n\n<p>That should worry anyone who believes governing requires knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>It should especially worry anyone who remembers that international cooperation, however tedious, is how we prevent the kind of catastrophic miscalculations that lead to wider conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Authority</p>\n\n<p>Article II gives the President authority to conduct foreign relations. That's not in dispute. But the Senate ratifies treaties. Congress appropriates funds. The President doesn't have unilateral authority to remake American foreign policy through executive orders that repudiate decades of treaty commitments.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these withdrawals involve treaties that required Senate consent. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change was ratified by the Senate in 1992. The President can implement it or not implement it. He cannot unilaterally withdraw from obligations that the Senate approved and that bind the United States under international law.</p>\n\n<p>Unless we've decided that doesn't matter anymore. Unless executive authority now extends to rewriting the constitutional requirements for treaty-making. Unless \"America First\" means the President can disregard the separation of powers when international commitments are involved.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that no one is seriously contesting this should alarm us. The fact that it's being normalized as presidential prerogative, that it's being framed as housekeeping rather than constitutional significance, that's how precedent gets set. Not with fanfare, but with acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Costs</p>\n\n<p>The immediate costs are practical. Disease surveillance gets harder when we're not part of the World Health Organization. Maritime safety suffers when we withdraw from the organizations that coordinate it. Climate cooperation collapses when we reject the treaties that enable it.</p>\n\n<p>The long-term costs are strategic. Other nations will conclude that the United States is not a reliable partner. They will build alternative systems. They will make agreements without us. American influence will wane not because we're weak, but because we're erratic.</p>\n\n<p>But the constitutional cost is deeper. We are establishing that international commitments are provisional, that treaty obligations don't bind future administrations, that the President can withdraw from any international body he deems contrary to his agenda.</p>\n\n<p>That's not how republics maintain credibility. That's how they become indistinguishable from autocracies, where policy is whatever the leader says it is today.</p>\n\n<p>## The Line That Matters</p>\n\n<p>Madison warned about the \"accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands.\" He understood that constitutional government requires distributing power so that no single authority can act without constraint.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign policy requires executive flexibility. No one disputes that. But withdrawal from treaty obligations that the Senate approved, defunding of organizations that Congress authorized, categorical rejection of international cooperation without legislative input, that's not flexibility. That's consolidation.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether these organizations are perfect. None of them are. The question is whether the President can unilaterally decide that American participation in the international order is optional, that treaty commitments don't bind him, that cooperation depends on his assessment of whether other nations advance \"woke\" agendas.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, we should say so clearly. We should acknowledge that we've changed the Constitution's allocation of foreign policy authority. We should admit that the Senate's role in treaty-making is now ceremonial, that presidential power extends to repudiating any international commitment he finds inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, someone needs to contest it. Congress needs to assert its authority. Courts need to examine whether these withdrawals exceed presidential power. Citizens need to ask whether this is compatible with constitutional government.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we're doing none of those things. We're accepting it as normal. We're treating it as politics, not principle. We're watching the architecture of international order get dismantled by executive order and calling it efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>That's the line that's moving. Not with violence, not with crisis, but with bureaucratic language and categorical withdrawal. The question is whether anyone will defend it.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength. But only when the Union is bound by more than executive preference. Only when commitments mean something beyond the current occupant's agenda. Only when cooperation is seen as strength, not weakness.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served twenty-two years in government work. I signed treaties. I attended multilateral meetings. I sat in rooms where nations with opposing interests found ways to coordinate on narrow, technical problems: disease surveillance, solar panel standards, counter-terrorism intelligence, climate data.</p>\n\n<p>Some of those meetings were productive. Some were bureaucratic theater. All of them represented something specific: the willingness of sovereign nations to bind themselves, however loosely, to shared rules.</p>\n\n<p>This week, the United States withdrew from sixty-six international organizations by presidential memorandum.</p>\n\n<p>Not through Senate debate. Not through public hearings on what these bodies do or whether American participation serves American interests. By executive pen, in a single afternoon, citing \"globalist agendas\" and \"wasted taxpayer dollars.\"</p>\n\n<p>Included in the list: the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the foundation of all international climate diplomacy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which coordinates the world's leading scientists on temperature data. The International Solar Alliance. The Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.</p>\n\n<p>Sixty-six organizations. One memo.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about climate policy. This is about the architecture of accountability.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution specifies that the president may make treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur.\" It does not specify what happens when a president withdraws from them.</p>\n\n<p>That silence has created a loophole large enough to drive an entire foreign policy through.</p>\n\n<p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and ratified by the Senate with a vote of unanimous consent. It was not a partisan document. It committed the United States to participate in international efforts to monitor and address climate change, a commitment twenty-eight years in the making.</p>\n\n<p>It now ends, for the second time in five years, by memorandum.</p>\n\n<p>No Senate vote. No public process. No debate over whether the benefits of participation outweigh the costs, whether American scientists should be blocked from attending IPCC meetings in China, whether withdrawing from the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum serves national security.</p>\n\n<p>Just the assertion that these bodies no longer serve American interests, as determined by one person.</p>\n\n<p>The precedent is breathtaking.</p>\n\n<p>## What Withdrawal Actually Means</p>\n\n<p>I want to be specific about what some of these organizations do, because \"globalist agenda\" is a phrase designed to stop thought rather than invite it.</p>\n\n<p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change does not impose carbon taxes. It does not regulate American industry. It provides a forum where nations share temperature data, coordinate emissions monitoring, and negotiate voluntary commitments. American withdrawal means American scientists will be excluded from climate research collaborations. It means the next generation of IPCC reports, which guide global understanding of warming trends, may be delayed or published without American input.</p>\n\n<p>The Global Counter-Terrorism Forum coordinates intelligence sharing among forty member nations on terrorist financing, border security, and emerging threats. Withdrawal does not make America safer. It makes American intelligence agencies less informed.</p>\n\n<p>The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance studies election security, voting systems, and democratic governance. It has no enforcement power. It publishes research.</p>\n\n<p>These are not shadowy cabals imposing world government. They are technical bodies doing the unglamorous work of international coordination. The United States participated in them because participation provided information, influence, and early warning of problems that do not stop at borders.</p>\n\n<p>Withdrawal is not a reassertion of sovereignty. It is the voluntary abandonment of influence.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization of Unilateral Power</p>\n\n<p>I have watched this pattern before. In different contexts, under different administrations, with different justifications.</p>\n\n<p>An emergency power is asserted. It is used. It becomes normal. The next use is broader. The emergency becomes the baseline.</p>\n\n<p>What we are witnessing is the normalization of unilateral withdrawal from binding commitments made by previous governments and ratified by the Senate. The principle being established is that any president may exit any treaty, at any time, for any reason, without legislative consultation.</p>\n\n<p>That principle does not stop with climate agreements or democracy institutes.</p>\n\n<p>If a president may withdraw from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change without Senate approval, may they withdraw from NATO without Senate approval? From the Geneva Conventions? From mutual defense treaties with Japan or South Korea?</p>\n\n<p>The White House will say those are different. But on what constitutional basis? If the ratification power resides in the Senate but the withdrawal power resides solely in the executive, then treaty commitments are only as durable as the current occupant of the Oval Office.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a treaty. That is a memo.</p>\n\n<p>## What We Are Not Asking</p>\n\n<p>The debate over these withdrawals has focused on climate science, on whether global warming is real, on whether international cooperation is good policy.</p>\n\n<p>Those are important questions. They are not the constitutional question.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is this: Can a president, acting alone, nullify commitments made by the United States government and ratified by the Senate?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then the Senate's treaty power is ornamental. Any international commitment can be undone by the next election. America's word lasts four years.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then these withdrawals should be challenged in court, and Congress should clarify through statute what the withdrawal process requires.</p>\n\n<p>We are not having that debate. We are having a debate about climate models and taxpayer dollars and globalism, as if those are the questions that matter most.</p>\n\n<p>They are not. The question that matters most is whether the constitutional process for making and keeping commitments still binds the executive branch.</p>\n\n<p>No one in power seems interested in asking it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern Across Administrations</p>\n\n<p>I am not blind to history. Presidents of both parties have stretched executive power. President Obama used executive action to enter the Paris Climate Agreement without Senate ratification, precisely because he knew the Senate would not ratify it. President Trump withdrew from it by the same unilateral method.</p>\n\n<p>Both actions were constitutionally questionable. Both normalized the idea that international commitments do not require legislative process.</p>\n\n<p>The difference now is scale. Sixty-six organizations in one day. Not controversial treaties subject to partisan divide, but technical bodies on solar energy and election security and scientific research.</p>\n\n<p>The assertion is not that these specific agreements are flawed. The assertion is that the president has plenary authority to exit any international commitment, for any reason, without constraint.</p>\n\n<p>That assertion is incompatible with the constitutional design.</p>\n\n<p>## What Is Being Lost</p>\n\n<p>When the United States withdraws from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, American scientists lose access to the coordinated global research that shapes understanding of temperature trends, sea level rise, and extreme weather patterns.</p>\n\n<p>When we withdraw from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, we lose the ability to share intelligence on election interference and authoritarian tactics threatening democratic systems worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>When we withdraw from the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, we lose real-time coordination with allies on terrorist financing networks.</p>\n\n<p>These are not symbolic losses. They are operational losses. They make America less informed, less influential, and less secure.</p>\n\n<p>But the greater loss is constitutional. We are normalizing the idea that binding commitments are not binding. That the word of the United States lasts only until the next administration. That treaties ratified by the Senate can be discarded by a president who finds them inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>If that becomes the standard, no nation will negotiate durable agreements with us. Why would they? Our commitments mean nothing.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution created a system of separated powers because the Founders understood that concentrated authority, even in well-meaning hands, tends toward tyranny.</p>\n\n<p>The treaty power was deliberately shared between the executive and legislative branches. The president negotiates. The Senate consents. Both are required.</p>\n\n<p>That design was not an accident. It was meant to ensure that international commitments reflected the deliberate judgment of the American people through their representatives, not the preferences of a single executive.</p>\n\n<p>If withdrawal from treaties requires no Senate involvement, then that design is dead.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a partisan argument. It is a constitutional one. The question is not whether climate agreements are good policy. The question is whether the process by which we make and break international commitments still reflects the constitutional structure.</p>\n\n<p>It does not.</p>\n\n<p>Sixty-six organizations. One memo. No debate.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how a republic governs. That is how an executive rules.</p>\n\n<p>The question we should be asking is not whether these organizations served American interests. The question we should be asking is whether a single person, without legislative check, should have the power to exit commitments made by the United States government.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is in the Constitution. We need only look.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

He has offered to do this \"the easy way or the hard way.\" The White House confirms it will not rule out annexing this territory by force.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a negotiating position. This is a declaration that might makes right.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in service to this country's defense. I know the strategic importance of Arctic territory. I know the value of early warning systems and the challenges of monitoring Russian submarine activity. I know that Greenland's location matters to American security.</p>\n\n<p>But I also know this: We already have a base there. We already have defense agreements. We already have the capability to bring as many troops as we need under existing treaties with Denmark. The strategic value is secured.</p>\n\n<p>So what, exactly, requires ownership?</p>\n\n<p>The president says countries need ownership, not leases. That leases are insufficient for defense. That America must possess Greenland because we cannot trust agreements with allies.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what that means.</p>\n\n<p>It means treaties are worthless. It means alliances are temporary. It means that when strategic interest demands it, sovereign borders become suggestions. It means the United States, when it perceives necessity, will take what it wants from those weaker than itself.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Greenland's minerals or its melting ice revealing rare earth deposits. This is about whether law constrains power or merely decorates it.</p>\n\n<p>The Greenlandic people have spoken clearly: \"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\" Their political leaders, across parties, issued a joint statement. This is not a divided population waiting for liberation. This is a people defending their right to self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>Self-determination. The principle America claimed in 1776. The principle we supposedly fought for in two world wars. The principle enshrined in the UN Charter that our NATO allies invoked this week: \"sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders.\"</p>\n\n<p>Unless, apparently, we decide otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>**What Alliances Mean**</p>\n\n<p>Denmark is a NATO member. NATO operates on Article 5: an attack on one is an attack on all. It is the most successful military alliance in history precisely because its members trust that their sovereignty will be respected, that their territorial integrity is guaranteed by collective defense.</p>\n\n<p>Now the United States is threatening to seize territory from a NATO ally. By force if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark's foreign ministry stated that military action against Greenland would spell the end of NATO. That is not hyperbole. That is a simple statement of fact. An alliance whose leading member annexes territory from another member has no meaning. It is not an alliance. It is a protection racket.</p>\n\n<p>Every NATO member now must ask: If America will threaten Denmark, what prevents them from threatening us? If strategic interest outweighs treaty obligations with Copenhagen, why would it not outweigh them with Warsaw, with Tallinn, with Vilnius?</p>\n\n<p>The President says NATO needs to understand this. What NATO understands is that American security guarantees may be worthless if they conflict with American ambitions.</p>\n\n<p>**The Venezuela Precedent**</p>\n\n<p>This isn't happening in isolation. Days before the Greenland statements, the administration used military force to seize Venezuela's president. Whatever one thinks of Nicolás Maduro, whatever crimes he may have committed, the United States deployed military power to extract a head of state from a sovereign nation.</p>\n\n<p>The easy way or the hard way.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is clear. When the President determines that American interests require it, sovereign borders become irrelevant. International law becomes optional. The wishes of the people living in those territories become background noise.</p>\n\n<p>This is how empires think. This is not how republics think.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 41: \"Security against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society. It is an avowed and essential object of the American Union.\" He was right. National security is fundamental. But Madison also knew that republics could become empires, that the pursuit of security could become the pursuit of dominion.</p>\n\n<p>Security justifies defense. It does not justify conquest.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether Greenland is strategically valuable. The question is whether strategic value justifies taking sovereign territory by force.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether Denmark would sell Greenland. Denmark has said clearly it will not, and Greenland's people have said they don't want to be sold. The question is whether that refusal matters.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether America has the military power to take Greenland. We obviously do. The question is whether power alone determines right.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether other nations would do the same. Russia annexed Crimea using precisely this logic: strategic necessity, historical connection, the wishes of great powers overriding the sovereignty of small nations. We condemned it then. The question is whether we will embrace it now.</p>\n\n<p>Every American should ask: If strategic interest justifies seizing friendly territory, what principle limits that power? If treaty obligations can be discarded when inconvenient, what promises can any nation trust? If the rule of law applies only when expedient, why have law at all?</p>\n\n<p>These aren't abstract questions. These are the questions that determine whether we remain a republic or become something else.</p>\n\n<p>**The Architecture of Restraint**</p>\n\n<p>The American system was built on a profound distrust of concentrated power. The Founders understood that good intentions do not make tyranny impossible. They understood that today's emergency becomes tomorrow's precedent. They understood that power, once claimed, is rarely surrendered.</p>\n\n<p>That's why they built restraints. Separation of powers. Federalism. Enumerated authorities. The requirement that treaties be ratified by the Senate. The principle that Congress alone declares war.</p>\n\n<p>These restraints exist because the Founders knew that executives claiming emergency always have reasons. The threat is always real. The necessity is always pressing. The action is always temporary.</p>\n\n<p>And the precedent is always permanent.</p>\n\n<p>When the President says we need to own Greenland \"the easy way or the hard way,\" he is not just threatening Denmark. He is declaring that American power answers to no law but necessity, to no authority but itself.</p>\n\n<p>That is not the statement of a republic. That is the statement of an empire.</p>\n\n<p>**In Union There is Strength**</p>\n\n<p>Our alliances were built on shared principle, not shared profit. We defended Europe not because it enriched us but because we believed in collective security, in the rule of law, in the sovereignty of nations. We built NATO not to extract tribute but to prevent aggression.</p>\n\n<p>Those alliances made us stronger. Not because we dominated them, but because they trusted us. Trust is strategic value. Trust is what allows forward basing. Trust is what enables intelligence sharing. Trust is what makes collective defense possible.</p>\n\n<p>Threatening to seize Greenland destroys that trust. Saying \"the easy way or the hard way\" to an ally destroys that trust. Making NATO members wonder if their sovereignty is contingent on our convenience destroys that trust.</p>\n\n<p>Trust, once lost, cannot be rebuilt by force.</p>\n\n<p>The Greenlandic people have said they want to remain Greenlandic. Denmark has said the territory is not for sale. Our NATO allies have reaffirmed their commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity. The question is whether America will honor those principles or abandon them in pursuit of strategic advantage.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, defines who we are.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have watched governments restrict press access before. I have seen authorities justify closing borders and controlling information in the name of security. I have reviewed intelligence dossiers that justified surveillance in wartime. But I have never seen a democratic state ban humanitarian organizations for the crime of describing what they see.</p>\n\n<p>That is what Israel has done.</p>\n\n<p>On January 1, Israel barred Doctors Without Borders and approximately forty other international aid groups from entering Gaza and the West Bank. The stated reason: failure to meet new \"security and transparency standards.\" The practical effect: silencing independent witnesses to what is happening in a territory under military occupation.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about Hamas. This is about accountability.</p>\n\n<p>## The Mechanism of Control</p>\n\n<p>The new Israeli registration requirements are precise. Aid groups must provide complete disclosure of all staff identities and roles. They must not engage in \"delegitimization activities against Israel\" or \"legal persecution of IDF soldiers.\" Their licenses can be revoked for supporting findings that Israel opposes, including international legal determinations.</p>\n\n<p>These are not security measures. These are speech codes.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what Israel demands: aid workers must hand over staff lists to a party to the conflict, knowing that more than 400 aid workers have been killed in Gaza in the past two years. They must refrain from documenting what international law defines as potential war crimes. They must not testify to what they witness if that testimony might be used in international courts.</p>\n\n<p>This is asking humanitarian workers to choose between bearing witness and maintaining access. It is making documentation itself a disqualifying act.</p>\n\n<p>## When Neutrality Requires Silence</p>\n\n<p>Doctors Without Borders has operated in conflict zones for decades. It treated casualties in Chechnya, Syria, Yemen. It maintained presence under Taliban rule, in territories controlled by ISIS, in regions where governments and insurgents both operated. It did so by maintaining strict neutrality: treating all wounded regardless of faction, documenting conditions without political judgment, and speaking truthfully about what its medical teams observe.</p>\n\n<p>Israel now says this constitutes abandonment of neutrality.</p>\n\n<p>The charge is revealing. What Israel calls \"delegitimization\" is what medical organizations call testimony. MSF staff described children with severe burns from Israeli airstrikes. They documented malnutrition consistent with famine conditions. They reported seeing people shot while seeking food at distribution sites Israel established and protected.</p>\n\n<p>These are observations, not accusations. They are recorded in medical files, verified by physical evidence, corroborated across multiple facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Israel's position is that such descriptions are inherently hostile. That bearing witness is itself an act of delegitimization. That neutrality requires not documenting suffering if that documentation might support legal claims Israel disputes.</p>\n\n<p>This is not how free societies treat evidence.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Question</p>\n\n<p>The United States faces a version of this question constantly: when does national security justify restricting information? When can the government control who may enter zones of conflict? When does operational necessity trump the public's right to independent verification?</p>\n\n<p>The answers are established in law and precedent. The government may restrict access for specific military necessity, but not to prevent documentation of its actions. It may classify information that would compromise operations, but not embarrass officials. It may control borders, but not to ensure only favorable accounts emerge.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in the Virginia Report of 1800 that \"a popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy.\" He was defending the right of citizens to receive information even during the quasi-war with France. The principle was that representative government requires informed judgment, and informed judgment requires independent access to facts.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli ban operates in reverse. It ensures that only official accounts reach the public. It removes independent medical verification. It eliminates the possibility of documentation that might contradict state narratives.</p>\n\n<p>This is not unique to Israel. Governments at war have always sought to control information. What is new is claiming this as a legitimate security measure compatible with democratic governance. What is dangerous is the precedent: that humanitarian access can be conditioned on political silence, that bearing witness can be classified as hostile activity, that medical testimony can be suppressed as delegitimization.</p>\n\n<p>## The American Interest</p>\n\n<p>The United States provides military aid to Israel under laws requiring that recipients not restrict humanitarian assistance. The Foreign Assistance Act conditions aid on compliance with international humanitarian law. The Leahy Law prohibits assistance to units credibly accused of gross human rights violations.</p>\n\n<p>These laws assume verification. They assume independent monitors can document conditions. They assume the United States can base policy on facts rather than assurances.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli ban eliminates that assumption. It removes the independent observers whose reports inform congressional oversight. It ensures that future assessments of humanitarian conditions will rely on Israeli military sources or exhausted local staff working without international expertise, supplies, or protection.</p>\n\n<p>This affects American law. It affects American appropriations. It affects American compliance with statutes governing foreign assistance. And it creates a precedent: that recipients of American military aid may restrict access, control information, and prevent documentation of how that aid is used.</p>\n\n<p>That precedent extends beyond this conflict. If conditioning humanitarian access on political silence is acceptable, then every recipient of American assistance has a model. If removing independent witnesses is justified by security necessity, then oversight becomes optional. If medical testimony can be classified as delegitimization, then evidence becomes whatever the government says it is.</p>\n\n<p>## What History Shows</p>\n\n<p>In 1968, the My Lai massacre remained hidden for over a year because independent journalists had limited access to operational areas in Vietnam. When exposed, the revelations shocked the American public and changed the conduct of the war. The lesson was not that the press should have been excluded further. It was that military operations in a democracy require independent verification precisely because governments cannot be trusted to investigate themselves.</p>\n\n<p>During the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s, humanitarian organizations provided the documentation that later formed the basis for war crimes prosecutions. The Srebrenica massacre, initially denied by Serbian forces and obscured by competing claims, was verified through medical examinations, refugee interviews, and physical evidence collected by aid workers who maintained access through the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern is consistent. Independent witnesses serve not the enemy but the historical record. They provide evidence that can support or refute claims by all parties. Their presence constrains atrocities not by preventing them but by ensuring they will be documented, investigated, and judged.</p>\n\n<p>Israel now says such documentation is illegitimate. That the presence of observers who might testify against state actions is itself a security threat. That humanitarian access must be conditioned on silence about what is witnessed.</p>\n\n<p>This is the logic of impunity.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Before Us</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Israel's security concerns are legitimate. The question is whether those concerns justify eliminating independent verification of what occurs in occupied territory.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether aid organizations have political views. The question is whether medical observations constitute delegitimization or evidence.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Israel has the power to impose these restrictions. The question is whether such restrictions are compatible with democratic governance, international humanitarian law, and American legal obligations.</p>\n\n<p>These are not abstract questions. They determine whether independent fact-finding is possible in conflict zones. They determine whether medical testimony is protected or can be classified as hostile activity. They determine whether American military assistance enables actions that cannot withstand documentation.</p>\n\n<p>The answers matter beyond this conflict. They establish whether democracies at war must tolerate independent verification or may remove witnesses. They establish whether conditioning aid on political silence is a legitimate security measure or suppression of evidence. They establish whether international humanitarian law means what it says or can be suspended when documentation becomes inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>## A 14-year-old needs surgery his mother cannot afford. An 8-year-old with severe burns needs specialized care unavailable in Gaza's shattered hospitals. A young man with shrapnel wounds needs physical therapy his body will never fully recover without.</p>\n\n<p>These are not abstractions. These are people named in medical files at MSF clinics that may close because Israel has classified medical testimony as delegitimization.</p>\n\n<p>The constitutional question is whether a society that values liberty can support restrictions on humanitarian access designed to prevent documentation of suffering. The policy question is whether the United States should condition military assistance on allowing independent verification. The moral question is whether we are comfortable with a precedent that treats bearing witness as grounds for exclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Those questions remain open. The closures proceed.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in government. You learn to read the distance between what is said and what can actually be done.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump says Iran wants to negotiate. He says a meeting is being set up. Iran's government has said nothing of the kind.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a diplomatic breakthrough. This is something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern of Claimed Authority</p>\n\n<p>Trump has threatened military strikes against Iran over its crackdown on protesters. Death toll: at least 544. More than 10,600 detained. The internet is shut down. Phone lines are cut. Iran's Revolutionary Guard is sending text messages warning parents to keep their children off the streets or face charges of treason.</p>\n\n<p>The President says he may have to act before any meeting takes place. \"We may have to act because of what's happening before the meeting.\"</p>\n\n<p>Here is the constitutional question: On what authority would the United States strike Iran to protect Iranian protesters from their own government?</p>\n\n<p>Not treaty obligation. Not defense of American forces. Not imminent threat to the homeland.</p>\n\n<p>Humanitarian intervention by unilateral presidential order.</p>\n\n<p>That's not in Article II. It's not anywhere in the Constitution. Congress has the power to declare war. The President is Commander in Chief of forces Congress authorizes. Even the War Powers Resolution, passed over a presidential veto in 1973, requires notification within 48 hours and withdrawal within 60 days absent congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Trump is discussing military action as if it requires only his decision. As if Iran's internal brutality, however horrific, creates presidential war power by executive will alone.</p>\n\n<p>This is how constitutional boundaries disappear, not through dramatic confrontation but through the quiet assertion that what was never authorized has somehow become permissible.</p>\n\n<p>## The Diplomatic Claim That Cannot Be Verified</p>\n\n<p>\"Iran called, they want to negotiate.\"</p>\n\n<p>Iran's Foreign Minister just told foreign diplomats in Tehran that \"the situation has come under total control.\" He blamed the U.S. and Israel for the violence. He called for pro-government rallies. Iranian state television broadcast chants of \"Death to America!\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not the posture of a government seeking talks.</p>\n\n<p>Oman's Foreign Minister did travel to Iran this weekend. Oman has served as an intermediary before, most notably in the negotiations that led to the 2015 nuclear agreement. But intermediation requires two parties willing to talk.</p>\n\n<p>What we have instead is a president claiming negotiations are imminent while threatening strikes, and an Iranian government showing no interest in compromise while conducting a violent crackdown.</p>\n\n<p>This matters because the claim of negotiations justifies delay in congressional consultation. If talks are happening, if a diplomatic solution is within reach, then perhaps Congress need not be involved yet. Perhaps the President needs flexibility.</p>\n\n<p>But if no negotiations are actually happening, then what we have is the executive branch manufacturing a justification for unilateral action while sidelining the legislative branch's constitutional role in decisions about war.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison warned against this in Federalist 51: \"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\" The separation of powers exists precisely to prevent one branch from claiming authority it does not possess.</p>\n\n<p>## The Crisis That Justifies Anything</p>\n\n<p>The situation in Iran is genuinely terrible. Protesters are being killed. The internet blackout prevents verification of what is happening. The government is warning parents their children will be charged with treason for demonstrating.</p>\n\n<p>This creates real moral pressure to do something.</p>\n\n<p>But \"something must be done\" has justified nearly every expansion of executive power in American history. The Alien and Sedition Acts. Suspension of habeas corpus. Japanese internment. Warrantless surveillance. Indefinite detention. Drone strikes without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, the emergency was real. Each time, the claim was that normal constitutional processes were too slow, too cumbersome, inadequate to the crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Each time, the expansion of executive power persisted long after the emergency ended.</p>\n\n<p>Lincoln suspended habeas corpus to preserve the Union. The government still claims authority to detain American citizens without trial as enemy combatants. That's 160 years of constitutional erosion stemming from a Civil War emergency.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Iran's government is brutal. It is.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether that brutality authorizes the American President to launch military strikes without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>The answer under the Constitution is no.</p>\n\n<p>## What Accountability Looks Like</p>\n\n<p>Trump's national security team is weighing \"cyberattacks and direct strikes by the U.S. or Israel.\" Anonymous sources. Not authorized to comment publicly.</p>\n\n<p>If the President orders strikes, will he notify Congress within 48 hours as the War Powers Resolution requires?</p>\n\n<p>Will he seek congressional authorization if operations continue beyond 60 days?</p>\n\n<p>Will he claim that protecting protesters from their government constitutes defense of vital national interests?</p>\n\n<p>Will Congress insist on its constitutional role, or will it defer to executive judgment?</p>\n\n<p>These are not hypothetical questions. This is how we find out whether the Constitution still governs decisions about war, or whether it has become merely advisory when the President believes circumstances require action.</p>\n\n<p>Iran's parliament speaker warned that U.S. military forces and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if America uses force. That means American service members' lives would be at risk.</p>\n\n<p>Those service members swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. They are entitled to know that when they are sent into harm's way, it is pursuant to constitutional authority, not presidential assertion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Silence That Matters Most</p>\n\n<p>Congress has said almost nothing.</p>\n\n<p>No demand for briefings. No insistence on consultation before any military action. No assertion of its constitutional role in decisions about war.</p>\n\n<p>Just silence.</p>\n\n<p>That silence is more dangerous than Trump's threats. Presidents will always claim emergency power. What matters is whether Congress defends its constitutional role.</p>\n\n<p>If it does not, if it simply accepts presidential claims to unilateral war-making authority, then the constitutional structure for decisions about war has effectively been amended without going through Article V.</p>\n\n<p>Not by vote. Not by debate. By acquiescence.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Trump or Iran or this particular crisis. It's about whether Congress will defend its constitutional role in decisions that risk American lives, or whether that role has simply been surrendered to the executive branch.</p>\n\n<p>The test of constitutional government is not whether power is used wisely. It is whether power is exercised lawfully.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, a president is threatening military action without clear constitutional authority, claiming negotiations that cannot be verified, and facing no meaningful congressional constraint.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how the Constitution allocates war powers.</p>\n\n<p>The question for Congress is simple: Do you still claim your constitutional role, or have you given it away?</p>\n\n<p>The silence is the answer.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have stood in polling places on three continents. I have watched citizens in new democracies wait hours to cast ballots they believed would matter. I have also stood in places where voting was theater, where the outcome was known, where the process existed not to choose leaders but to ratify power already held.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in Uganda is not an election in the sense we understand it. It is a ritual of legitimation.</p>\n\n<p>President Yoweri Museveni has ruled for forty years. He came to power in 1986 condemning leaders who \"want to overstay in power.\" That was the year I graduated from college. Children born when he took office are now forty years old, have children of their own, and have never known another president. His son commands the military and posts on social media about his inevitable succession.</p>\n\n<p>This is not democracy. This is dynasty with electoral aesthetics.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Inevitability</p>\n\n<p>The internet is shut down. Hundreds of activists are detained. Opposition rallies are dispersed with tear gas. Journalists face restrictions. The challenger campaigns in body armor because he has been shot by police. Voters are barred from observing vote counts.</p>\n\n<p>The government calls these measures \"security.\"</p>\n\n<p>That word does important work. It transforms repression into protection. It makes the abnormal sound responsible. It suggests that shutting down communications, arresting dissidents, and blocking election monitors are not instruments of control but responses to threat.</p>\n\n<p>This is how temporary becomes permanent. This is how exception becomes rule.</p>\n\n<p>The Uganda Communications Commission says the internet blackout is \"a precautionary intervention to ensure peace, protect national stability and prevent the misuse of communication platforms during a sensitive national exercise.\" Note the language: precautionary, ensure, protect, prevent. This is the vocabulary of guardianship, not governance. It assumes that the population cannot be trusted with information during the very moment they are asked to make decisions about their future.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison understood what this reveals: \"A popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps both.\"</p>\n\n<p>## The Performance of Consent</p>\n\n<p>Elections under these conditions serve a purpose, but it is not selection. They demonstrate reach. They map support. They identify opposition. They create the appearance of legitimacy for international consumption. They let the government claim a mandate.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, they normalize the arrangement.</p>\n\n<p>Every time this happens without consequence, the idea that it could be otherwise recedes. The opposition candidate campaigns despite knowing he will not be allowed to win. Voters cast ballots despite knowing the outcome. International observers issue reports. Western governments express concern. And nothing changes.</p>\n\n<p>This is not accident. This is design.</p>\n\n<p>The process teaches learned helplessness. It demonstrates that resistance is performative, that opposition is tolerated only when it is ineffective, that the forms of democracy can persist indefinitely without any of its substance.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen this before. I watched it in places where militaries held elections to demonstrate civilian support. I watched it in places where one-party states held votes to show popular approval. The mechanics differ. The lesson is the same: power concedes nothing without compulsion, and compulsion requires organization that the state will not permit.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question of Legitimacy</p>\n\n<p>Here is what matters: Museveni is strategically valuable to Western governments. He deploys troops to trouble spots. He accepts deportees. He cooperates on counterterrorism. He is, in the language of realpolitik, \"our son of a bitch.\"</p>\n\n<p>This calculation is not new. It justified support for autocrats throughout the Cold War. It justified relationships with regimes that imprisoned dissidents, banned opposition, controlled media, and called it stability.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether those relationships undermine the very principles they claim to defend.</p>\n\n<p>When we accept that elections can be theater as long as the theater serves our interests, we are not defending democracy. We are defending its opposite. We are saying that legitimacy comes from cooperation with us, not consent of the governed.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham Lincoln said it plainly: \"No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.\"</p>\n\n<p>That principle does not have a geopolitical exception.</p>\n\n<p>## What We Are Watching</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-one million Ugandans are registered to vote. Most are under forty. They have lived their entire lives under one ruler. They are voting in an election where the internet is shut down, activists are jailed, opposition is harassed, and observers are blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Some will vote for Museveni because they support him. Some will vote for him because they fear the alternative. Some will vote for the opposition knowing it will not matter. Some will not vote at all.</p>\n\n<p>But they will all absorb the lesson that power does not change through peaceful means, that law protects authority rather than rights, that elections are not mechanisms of accountability but ceremonies of submission.</p>\n\n<p>That lesson does not stay in Uganda. It travels. It spreads. It becomes precedent.</p>\n\n<p>Every time an election happens under these conditions without consequence, the idea that it must be otherwise weakens. Every time we accept strategic autocracy as lesser evil, we erode the ground on which free societies stand.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>The question is not what will happen in Uganda. We know what will happen. Museveni will be declared the winner. There will be allegations of fraud. There will be international statements. There will be no change.</p>\n\n<p>The question is what that means for the principle that legitimate government derives from the consent of the governed.</p>\n\n<p>If that principle matters, it matters everywhere. If it matters everywhere, it cannot coexist with tactical exceptions. If we defend democracy only where it serves our interests, we do not defend democracy. We defend interests.</p>\n\n<p>I am not suggesting military intervention. I am not proposing sanctions. I am asking whether we have the clarity to call this what it is.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an election. This is a demonstration that elections can exist without democracy, that the forms can persist without the substance, that legitimacy can be claimed without consent.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>",

      "headline": "When Federal Force Becomes the First Response",
      "content": "<p>I served under rules of engagement more restrictive than what we're seeing in American cities.</p>\n\n<p>That's not a political statement. It's a fact. In Iraq, in Afghanistan, our authority to use force was bounded by law, by treaty, by chain of command, and by the knowledge that every shot fired would be investigated. We operated in combat zones under stricter accountability than ICE agents are operating in Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p>This matters now because the President has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress protests against federal law enforcement operations. Not to repel an invasion. Not to restore order after state authority has collapsed. To quell opposition to how federal agents are conducting immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>That's a different use of the military than the law contemplates.</p>\n\n<p>The Insurrection Act of 1807 permits the President to deploy active-duty military forces for domestic law enforcement under specific circumstances: when state authorities request help, when rebellion makes it impossible to enforce federal law, or when civil rights are being systematically denied. It has been invoked sparingly, twenty-nine times in 217 years, most recently in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots after California's governor requested assistance.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump has threatened to invoke it not because Minnesota lacks the capacity to maintain order, but because Minnesota officials oppose how federal agents are operating within their jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>That's not the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>## What Happened in Minneapolis</p>\n\n<p>The facts are these: On January 7, 2026, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good during what the administration calls a law enforcement operation and what video footage shows as a woman attempting to drive away while an agent stood in front of her vehicle. Three shots. The FBI is investigating.</p>\n\n<p>One week later, an ICE agent shot another man in the leg after what DHS characterizes as an ambush with a snow shovel and broom handle. Protests followed. Property was damaged. Federal vehicles were vandalized.</p>\n\n<p>The President then threatened to send in the military if state and local officials did not \"stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists.\"</p>\n\n<p>The predicate for military deployment is not that protests became disorderly. It is that civil authority has failed to function. There is no evidence that Minnesota lacks the capability to maintain order. The state has not requested assistance. The governor has asked to \"turn the temperature down,\" not for troops.</p>\n\n<p>What we're seeing instead is a federal operation generating local resistance, that resistance being labeled insurrection, and military force being threatened to suppress it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture of Accountability</p>\n\n<p>Three thousand federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota. That is more federal law enforcement personnel than are permanently stationed in most states. They are conducting what ICE calls Operation Metro Surge, making arrests, conducting raids, and using force under circumstances that remain unclear because the operations are not subject to the transparency requirements that govern local police.</p>\n\n<p>When a city police officer shoots someone, there are procedures. Body cameras. Use-of-force reviews. Public accountability through local government. When an ICE agent shoots someone, the investigation happens within DHS, the footage may or may not be released, and local officials have no authority to compel answers.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine 3,000 such officers operating in a city whose mayor has demanded they leave, whose governor has compared them to the Gestapo, and whose residents are watching videos of federal agents shooting people and wondering whether the law applies.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a stable equilibrium.</p>\n\n<p>The administration's response is to threaten military deployment against citizens protesting federal actions. Not deployment to assist local authorities in maintaining order. Deployment to override local opposition to federal operations.</p>\n\n<p>That changes what the Insurrection Act means.</p>\n\n<p>## The History That Matters</p>\n\n<p>The Act was written in 1807, expanded during Reconstruction, and refined after the civil rights era. It has been used to integrate schools, to suppress the Ku Klux Klan, to restore order after riots, and to enforce federal law when states attempted to nullify it.</p>\n\n<p>It has never been used, as far as I can determine, to suppress protests against how federal agents are conducting law enforcement operations within a jurisdiction where civil authority continues to function.</p>\n\n<p>This matters because the Act was designed as a last resort when the constitutional order breaks down. What we're seeing instead is its use being threatened as a first resort when local officials object to federal tactics.</p>\n\n<p>That is a different kind of power.</p>\n\n<p>When federal force becomes the answer to political opposition, when dissent is labeled insurrection, when local accountability is replaced by federal immunity, you have moved from law enforcement to something else.</p>\n\n<p>You have moved toward the kind of federal supremacy the Founders feared.</p>\n\n<p>## What Citizens Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether immigration laws should be enforced. The question is under what constraints, with what accountability, and subject to whose authority.</p>\n\n<p>When federal agents operate in American cities under rules less restrictive than soldiers operate under in combat zones, something has gone wrong.</p>\n\n<p>When 3,000 federal officers deploy without local consent or meaningful local oversight, something has changed.</p>\n\n<p>When the military is threatened against citizens protesting federal operations, not because civil authority has failed but because it disagrees, something fundamental has shifted.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 51 that \"ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\" The system works when power checks power, when federal authority is balanced by state authority, when accountability runs through multiple channels.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when federal force operates beyond state oversight, when protests against it are labeled insurrection, when the remedy for local opposition is military deployment?</p>\n\n<p>You get power without accountability.</p>\n\n<p>You get force without constraint.</p>\n\n<p>You get exactly what the Constitution was designed to prevent.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test</p>\n\n<p>I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath didn't include partisan caveats. It didn't say \"support this administration's policies\" or \"defend these particular outcomes.\" It said defend the constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>That order includes the principle that federal power is limited, that states retain authority, that accountability matters, and that force is employed under law, not instead of it.</p>\n\n<p>When an ICE agent shoots someone, there should be a transparent investigation. When 3,000 federal officers deploy to a city, there should be clarity about their authority and constraints. When the President threatens to send in the military, there should be a clear predicate that goes beyond \"local officials object to our operations.\"</p>\n\n<p>These are not partisan questions. They are constitutional questions about how power works in a republic.</p>\n\n<p>Right now in Minneapolis, federal agents are operating under unclear authority, with limited accountability, generating local opposition that is being labeled insurrection, with military force threatened as the remedy.</p>\n\n<p>If that becomes normal, something essential has been lost.</p>\n\n<p>The Insurrection Act was meant to preserve constitutional government, not to override it when local officials resist federal operations.

      "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to know how power moves, how it tests boundaries, how it transforms means into ends. What we're witnessing in Minneapolis isn't merely federal immigration enforcement. It's a stress test of constitutional architecture, conducted with tear gas and funding threats.</p>\n\n<p>The facts are straightforward. Federal agents surge into cities. A civilian is killed. Protests erupt. The administration threatens to invoke the Insurrection Act and simultaneously announces it will cut funding to cities that don't cooperate with its enforcement agenda. The method is familiar: create crisis, demand submission, punish resistance.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about immigration policy. This is about whether the federal government can commandeer state and local governments through financial coercion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Constitutional Architecture</p>\n\n<p>The Founders designed a system of dual sovereignty. James Madison explained it clearly in Federalist 45: \"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\"</p>\n\n<p>That division wasn't accidental. It was structural, deliberate, essential. The federal government enforces immigration law. States and cities run their own police departments, make their own public safety decisions, answer to their own voters. The Constitution does not permit Washington to conscript local law enforcement into federal service, nor to punish states financially for declining to assist.</p>\n\n<p>Courts have repeatedly affirmed this principle. In Printz v. United States (1997), the Supreme Court struck down federal attempts to commandeer state officers. The anti-commandeering doctrine holds that Congress cannot compel states to enforce federal law. The logic is simple: if Washington could force states to implement federal policy, the division of sovereignty would collapse. States would become administrative units, not sovereign governments.</p>\n\n<p>The spending power cases are equally clear. South Dakota v. Dole (1987) established that Congress can attach conditions to federal funding, but those conditions must relate to the purpose of the funds and cannot be so coercive that they amount to compulsion. In NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), the Court found that threatening to withhold all Medicaid funding unless states expanded the program crossed the line into unconstitutional coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Judge William Orrick's ruling blocking the Trump administration's sanctuary city funding threats follows directly from this precedent. The federal government cannot use money as a cudgel to force states to abandon their own policies. That's not federalism. That's subjugation.</p>\n\n<p>## Why Local Cooperation Matters</p>\n\n<p>The administration's frustration is understandable on operational grounds. ICE operated more efficiently when it could pick up individuals already in custody at local jails. Detainer requests—federal holds on individuals about to be released from local custody—streamlined the process.</p>\n\n<p>But efficiency isn't a constitutional argument.</p>\n\n<p>Local jurisdictions adopted sanctuary policies for reasons rooted in their own governance responsibilities. Police chiefs and mayors argued that cooperation with federal immigration enforcement undermined community trust, making immigrant communities reluctant to report crimes or cooperate with investigations. They concluded that their public safety mission required them to separate local policing from federal immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>Those are legitimate policy judgments. Citizens can disagree with them, can vote officials out who make them, can change state law to require cooperation. What citizens cannot do—what the federal government cannot do—is override state sovereignty through financial threats.</p>\n\n<p>The administration's response reveals the deeper problem. When state and local governments make decisions Washington dislikes, the federal playbook increasingly involves federal occupation (surge operations), federal prosecution (investigations of governors and mayors), and federal coercion (funding threats). Each step moves power from diffused to centralized, from accountable to distant, from constitutional order to executive will.</p>\n\n<p>## The Pattern That Should Concern Us</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this pattern before. An administration identifies a problem. Congress won't or can't act. The executive branch finds authorities—some legitimate, some stretched, some simply asserted—to act unilaterally. Opposition is framed as obstruction. Cooperation is demanded. Resistance is punished.</p>\n\n<p>The mechanisms vary but the trajectory is consistent: concentration of power, erosion of limitations, normalization of the extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what's happening simultaneously in Minnesota:</p>\n\n<p>- Federal agents deploying tear gas against protesters\n- A Justice Department investigation of state and local officials\n- Threats to invoke the Insurrection Act\n- Promises to cut federal funding\n- Military personnel operating alongside civilian law enforcement</p>\n\n<p>Each element, taken alone, might have a technical legal justification. Collectively, they represent something else: a demonstration of federal dominance, a warning to other jurisdictions, a redefinition of the relationship between Washington and everywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>This is how federalism dies—not in a single dramatic breach, but through accumulated pressure, through crises real and manufactured, through the transformation of cooperation into compulsion.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question We Should Be Asking</p>\n\n<p>The debate has focused on immigration enforcement and sanctuary policies. Those are important questions. But they're not the fundamental question.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental question is this: Can the federal government force state and local governments to implement federal policy by threatening their financial survival?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then federalism is dead. State sovereignty becomes administrative convenience. Local control becomes federal permission. The constitutional architecture collapses into a unitary system with power flowing in one direction—downward from Washington.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood this danger. Hamilton warned in Federalist 17 that the states would be \"constituent and essential parts of the federal government\" whose independence must be preserved. Madison argued in Federalist 46 that state governments could \"effectually oppose\" federal overreach through \"a refusal to cooperate with officers of the Union.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not obstruction. That's constitutional design working as intended.</p>\n\n<p>When Washington attempts to override state resistance through funding coercion, it's not enforcing the law. It's rewriting the constitutional settlement, replacing dual sovereignty with federal supremacy, replacing political accountability with administrative compliance.</p>\n\n<p>## What This Means</p>\n\n<p>Courts will sort out the immediate legal questions. Judges have already blocked similar funding threats. They likely will again. The anti-commandeering doctrine and the spending power limitations are well-established. The administration will lose these cases, just as it did in the first term.</p>\n\n<p>But that misses the point.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that we're normalizing these confrontations, accepting as routine the deployment of federal force into cities over policy disputes, treating as ordinary the threat to cut funding whenever states decline to cooperate. We're moving from federalism as structure to federalism as discretion, from constitutional limits as binding to constitutional limits as negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>I've sworn an oath to the Constitution enough times to know what it means. It means that powers not granted to the federal government remain with the states. It means that the federal government cannot compel state officers to enforce federal law. It means that spending power has limits. It means that federalism isn't just a theory—it's the architecture that makes self-government possible across a diverse republic.</p>\n\n<p>When that architecture erodes, we don't just lose efficiency or clarity. We lose the structural protection that keeps power from accumulating in a single place, that maintains multiple centers of authority, that preserves space for local democracy and political difference.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether you support sanctuary policies or immigration enforcement. The question is whether you believe the Constitution means what it says about the limits of federal power. The question is whether dual sovereignty still matters, or whether we're willing to trade it for the efficiency of centralized control.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in uniform. I served in government. I have sat in rooms where policy becomes action, where words on paper become orders that people follow. So I know what it looks like when power stops being bounded by law and starts being bounded only by will.</p>\n\n<p>What happened Saturday is not a trade policy dispute.</p>\n\n<p>It is the use of economic coercion against treaty allies to compel the transfer of sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>President Trump announced a 10% tariff on eight NATO members, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, effective February 1, escalating to 25% by June 1 if they do not facilitate \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States. Not negotiate. Not discuss. Purchase. As if an autonomous territory of 56,000 people, part of a democratic ally since the founding of NATO, were a warehouse property available for hostile takeover.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Greenland's strategic value. It is about whether an American president can weaponize the U.S. economy to dissolve the territorial integrity of allied democracies.</p>\n\n<p>**What Changed Without Announcement**</p>\n\n<p>Tariffs are a tool of trade policy. They address unfair practices, protect domestic industries, respond to economic injury. They operate within a framework of law: statutes, treaties, administrative procedures, judicial review.</p>\n\n<p>This is something else.</p>\n\n<p>These are not tariffs to address dumping or subsidies or market access. They are penalties imposed on allies for the offense of refusing to sell their land. The legal mechanism Trump would likely invoke, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, requires an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security. The threat here is that European nations will not surrender Greenland.</p>\n\n<p>If that becomes the standard for economic emergency powers, then emergency powers have no limiting principle.</p>\n\n<p>If a president can declare any diplomatic impasse a national emergency and unilaterally impose escalating penalties until compliance, then the entire architecture of alliance diplomacy collapses into unilateral will. The question is not whether Trump has the statutory language to attempt this. The question is whether that language was ever meant to authorize what he is attempting.</p>\n\n<p>Congress wrote emergency powers laws after Watergate specifically to constrain unilateral executive action. Section 1701 of IEEPA permits economic measures during a declared national emergency, but the declaration must identify an actual threat, not merely an unmet demand. Tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act require a finding that imports threaten national security, not that allies insufficiently defer.</p>\n\n<p>The law exists. But the law's meaning shifts when its invocation becomes routine, when every refusal becomes a threat, when \"emergency\" describes any inconvenient constraint on executive preference.</p>\n\n<p>**The Alliance Question**</p>\n\n<p>NATO is not a treaty of convenience. It is a mutual defense pact rooted in Article 5: an attack on one is an attack on all. It has held through the Berlin Airlift, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Balkan wars, September 11. Denmark, Norway, the UK, France, Germany, all of them, have sent their people to fight alongside ours under that covenant.</p>\n\n<p>Now the United States is threatening them with economic punishment for declining to cede sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>Senator Chris Coons stood in Copenhagen and said, \"If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?\"</p>\n\n<p>That is the question.</p>\n\n<p>Alliances are built on reliability. When reliability is replaced by ultimatum, when partnership becomes subordination, when \"ally\" means \"complies,\" then alliance becomes something else. It becomes hierarchy enforced by coercion. And hierarchies built on coercion do not endure.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark has been our ally for 77 years. It hosts U.S. forces at Thule Air Base in Greenland. It has committed troops to every major NATO operation. It has stood with us when standing cost blood. And now we are imposing trade penalties because it will not sell us Greenland.</p>\n\n<p>If that is how we treat Denmark, what does Poland believe? What does Estonia believe? What does any smaller ally believe about what America's word is worth?</p>\n\n<p>**The Question of Law**</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear, legally, how Trump intends to do this. Tariffs under existing statutory authority require specific findings, agency process, often congressional notification. The president cannot simply tweet a 10% penalty into existence. But the larger question is whether the legal framework itself still operates as a constraint or merely as a formality to be cited post hoc.</p>\n\n<p>James Madison wrote in Federalist 47, \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands... may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" The separation of powers exists not to slow government but to prevent exactly this: the conversion of law into the instrument of unilateral will.</p>\n\n<p>Emergency powers laws were designed to permit swift action in genuine crises, not to bypass Congress whenever diplomacy requires patience. The question is not whether a president has emergency authority. The question is whether that authority extends to creating the emergency it purports to address, to declaring any frustration a crisis, any refusal a threat.</p>\n\n<p>If it does, then Congress no longer legislates trade policy. It merely observes while the executive does.</p>\n\n<p>**What This Normalizes**</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, citing national security under Section 232. Allies objected. Courts mostly deferred. The precedent held: national security is whatever the president says it is, reviewable only at the margins.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, he threatened tariffs on Mexico to force immigration enforcement changes. Mexico complied. The lesson: economic coercion works when the target is weaker.</p>\n\n<p>Now he is applying that lesson to NATO allies, demanding not policy changes but territorial concessions, using trade as the lever. Each escalation builds on the last. Each instance that goes unchallenged becomes the baseline for the next.</p>\n\n<p>This is how norms erode. Not through dramatic constitutional collapse, but through incremental expansion, each step slightly beyond the last, each justified by precedent that itself was justified by convenience. The trade war becomes the diplomatic ultimatum becomes the demand for sovereign territory enforced by escalating economic penalties.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether this violates a specific statute. The question is whether this is compatible with a government of laws.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>Not: Do we want Greenland for strategic reasons?</p>\n\n<p>But: Do we want a presidency that can unilaterally coerce territorial concessions from allied democracies using emergency economic powers?</p>\n\n<p>Not: Are tariffs an effective tool?</p>\n\n<p>But: Are tariffs meant to enforce diplomatic demands that have nothing to do with trade?</p>\n\n<p>Not: Is this technically legal?</p>\n\n<p>But: Does law still constrain executive action, or does it merely describe what the president chooses to do?</p>\n\n<p>These are different questions. They go to structure, not policy. They ask whether power is still accountable to something beyond itself.</p>\n\n<p>**The Precedent**</p>\n\n<p>In 1803, Thomas Jefferson bought Louisiana from France. It was a negotiated purchase between willing parties, ratified by treaty, approved by the Senate. The Constitution did not explicitly authorize it, and Jefferson himself had doubts, but it proceeded through legal process.</p>\n\n<p>In 1867, William Seward bought Alaska from Russia. Again, a negotiated treaty, Senate ratification, legal appropriation.</p>\n\n<p>In 1917, the U.S. purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark. Treaty. Senate consent. Process.</p>\n\n<p>Territorial acquisition has always been exceptional, conducted through law, requiring consent at every level: the selling nation, the Senate, the appropriating Congress. It has never been imposed by presidential ultimatum enforced through unilateral economic penalties.</p>\n\n<p>Until now. If this proceeds.</p>\n\n<p>**The Test**</p>\n\n<p>Thousands marched in Copenhagen and Nuuk on Saturday, holding signs that read \"Greenland is not for sale\" and \"Hands off.\" They were not protesting American strategic interests. They were asserting self-governance. They were reminding the world that people are not property, that sovereignty is not a transaction.</p>\n\n<p>A Danish major general confirmed that Danish soldiers, if attacked on Danish soil, have the legal obligation to fight back. Even, presumably, if the attack comes from an ally.</p>\n\n<p>That is where this leads. Not to war, probably, but to the question of whether war is even conceivable, whether the bonds that held for 77 years still mean what they once did.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether Trump can find statutory language to justify tariffs. The test is whether the American constitutional system permits a president to use economic warfare to coerce territorial concessions from treaty allies, and whether Congress and the courts will allow it.</p>\n\n<p>The test is whether law still limits power, or whether power now defines law.</p>\n\n<p>That is the question this moment asks. And the answer will tell us what we still are.</p>",

Remarkable because it was said aloud.</p>\n\n<p>\"There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power.\"</p>\n\n<p>António Guterres was describing American foreign policy. He could have been describing a principle older than the Republic.</p>\n\n<p>I spent years in uniform defending what we called the rules-based international order. That phrase carried weight in briefing rooms and treaty negotiations. It meant something specific: that nations, including powerful ones, would bind themselves to shared rules rather than act solely on interest and capability.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether that binding was ever real, or whether it was a temporary arrangement of convenience that lasted only as long as American power was uncontested and American interests aligned with the appearance of law.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about whether the UN is effective. It isn't about whether international institutions need reform. It's about whether the United States remains a nation that believes law constrains power, or whether we have decided that our power defines what law means.</p>\n\n<p>**What We Agreed To**</p>\n\n<p>The United States drafted much of the UN Charter. American diplomats, shaped by two world wars, built the architecture of international law precisely to prevent powerful nations from acting with impunity.</p>\n\n<p>Article 2(4) of the Charter prohibits \"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\" The United States signed that treaty. The Senate ratified it. Under Article VI of the Constitution, it became \"the supreme Law of the Land.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not a suggestion. Not an aspiration. Law.</p>\n\n<p>When we helped write those rules in 1945, we understood something essential: that unchecked power, even our own, would eventually become a threat to liberty everywhere. That binding ourselves to law, even when inconvenient, was the price of maintaining a world where smaller nations had any protection at all.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative was the world we had just fought to end. The world where might made right and treaties were worth less than the paper they were printed on.</p>\n\n<p>We chose differently then.</p>\n\n<p>**The Drift**</p>\n\n<p>I served in government when phrases like \"kinetic military action\" replaced \"war\" in official documents. When \"enhanced interrogation\" replaced \"torture.\" When legal memos stretched definitions until they meant their opposite.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern was always the same: Find a way to do what power wanted, then construct a legal justification afterward. Not \"Is this lawful?\" but \"How can we make this appear lawful?\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not law. That's power wearing law's uniform.</p>\n\n<p>Guterres described what anyone watching American foreign policy can see: a nation that considers multilateral solutions irrelevant, that acts first and consults allies later, if at all. A nation that speaks of sovereignty and international law when they serve our interests, and dismisses them when they don't.</p>\n\n<p>The recent strike in Venezuela. The seizure of its president. The threats to annex Greenland, a territory of a NATO ally.</p>\n\n<p>These aren't legal arguments. They're demonstrations of capability.</p>\n\n<p>**The Constitutional Question**</p>\n\n<p>The Founders designed a government that could not easily make war. They split the war power deliberately, giving Congress the authority to declare war and the President the authority to command forces once war was declared.</p>\n\n<p>They did this because they had lived under unchecked executive power. They knew what it became.</p>\n\n<p>\"The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it,\" James Madison wrote. \"It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to the Legislature.\"</p>\n\n<p>Yet we have not formally declared war since 1942. We have fought wars in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, and elsewhere under various authorizations, resolutions, and executive determinations that bear little resemblance to the constitutional process the Founders mandated.</p>\n\n<p>This didn't happen overnight. It happened through accumulation. Through precedent built on precedent, each one citing the last. Through emergency powers that never expired and legal interpretations that never faced serious challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The line didn't move all at once. It drifted.</p>\n\n<p>**What Allies See**</p>\n\n<p>I remember what it meant to represent the United States overseas. To speak about human rights and rule of law with the authority of a nation that, however imperfectly, tried to live by those principles.</p>\n\n<p>That authority came from restraint as much as strength. From the times we could have acted on power alone but chose to work through law instead. From the credibility of being bound by the same rules we asked others to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Allies trusted us not because we were powerful, but because our power was, most of the time, predictable and constrained by institutions they could understand.</p>\n\n<p>When the Secretary-General of the UN describes American policy as a rejection of multilateralism and international law, he is telling us what our allies already know and what our adversaries have long claimed: that we consider ourselves exempt from the constraints we demand others accept.</p>\n\n<p>That is a different kind of power. It is also a different kind of isolation.</p>\n\n<p>**The Normalization**</p>\n\n<p>What concerns me most is not any single action. It's the quiet acceptance of a principle that would have alarmed the Founders: that American power, because it is power, operates in a different category than law.</p>\n\n<p>This principle doesn't announce itself. It accretes through practice. Through the assumption that what we can do, we may do. Through the absence of accountability when power is misused. Through the bipartisan consensus that executive authority in foreign affairs is essentially unchecked.</p>\n\n<p>It becomes normal to strike other nations without congressional authorization. Normal to detain people indefinitely without trial. Normal to invoke national security to avoid judicial review. Normal to treat international law as advisory.</p>\n\n<p>The extraordinary becomes ordinary. The emergency becomes permanent. The exception becomes the rule.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics change. Not through dramatic breaks, but through the steady erosion of constraints that once seemed essential.</p>\n\n<p>**The Test**</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if the rules-based international order can be salvaged. I don't know if institutions designed for 1945 can address 2025's challenges. I don't know if multilateral solutions can solve problems that unilateral power cannot.</p>\n\n<p>But I know this: A nation that believes its power places it above law is no longer constrained by law.</p>\n\n<p>That includes the law that constrains its power at home.</p>\n\n<p>The principle that power defines law doesn't stop at the border. If we are exempt from international law because we are powerful, why should the powerful within our own system be constrained by domestic law?</p>\n\n<p>The logic is the same. The justification is the same. Only the scale differs.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood something we risk forgetting: that unchecked power, even when wielded with good intentions, even when exercised by people we trust, eventually becomes a threat to liberty itself.</p>\n\n<p>They built a system designed to prevent that. A system where law constrained power, where institutions checked ambition, where no person or branch could act without accountability.</p>\n\n<p>That system didn't fail. We stopped maintaining it.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether the UN can reform itself. The question is whether the American people still believe that law should constrain power, or whether we have decided that our power is its own justification.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this still matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",

      "headline": "When Sovereignty Becomes Negotiable",
      "content": "<p>The President of the United States has announced that he will impose tariffs on eight NATO allies, including the United Kingdom, unless Denmark agrees to sell Greenland to Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Read that again.</p>\n\n<p>Not tariffs based on trade imbalances. Not tariffs as leverage in a security negotiation. Tariffs as the price for refusing to surrender sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>When asked if he would rule out using military force to take Greenland, the President replied: \"No comment.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Greenland's strategic value. This is about whether territorial integrity is still a principle that governs relations between free nations, or merely a preference that can be coerced away through economic threats.</p>\n\n<p>**The Mechanism Matters**</p>\n\n<p>I have served in government. I understand that nations pursue strategic interests. The United States has legitimate security concerns in the Arctic. Greenland's location matters to continental defense.</p>\n\n<p>But how a nation pursues those interests reveals what kind of nation it is.</p>\n\n<p>The President frames this as about \"National and World Security.\" That framing does important work. It suggests that opposition to the demand is not merely unwise but dangerous, not merely disagreement but dereliction.</p>\n\n<p>Notice what has disappeared from the conversation: any reference to the consent of the governed.</p>\n\n<p>Greenland is home to 56,000 people. They are not a commodity to be purchased. They possess the right to self-determination under international law, recognized in the UN Charter, Article 1. Their premier has stated clearly: \"We are not for sale.\"</p>\n\n<p>That should end the discussion in any framework where popular sovereignty matters.</p>\n\n<p>It has not ended the discussion.</p>\n\n<p>**When Alliances Become Conditional**</p>\n\n<p>The tariff threat targets eight nations. All are NATO members. All are democracies. All stood with the United States after September 11th under Article 5, the mutual defense clause that declares an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>\n\n<p>Denmark lost 43 soldiers in Afghanistan fighting alongside American forces. Norway lost 10. The United Kingdom lost 457.</p>\n\n<p>They did not die protecting trade advantages. They died because we invoked a treaty that says democracies defend each other.</p>\n\n<p>Now that treaty obligation is being made conditional on compliance with a territorial demand.</p>\n\n<p>The Danish foreign minister stated it plainly: \"You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not rhetoric. That is a statement about what separates law-governed nations from those where power is the only currency that matters.</p>\n\n<p>If sovereignty is negotiable when a stronger power demands it, then every treaty is merely a pause between coercions. Every border is temporary. Every alliance lasts only as long as the stronger party finds it convenient.</p>\n\n<p>**The Normalization**</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time extraordinary measures have been proposed in the name of security. The question is whether they become ordinary.</p>\n\n<p>In 2002, the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed Congress to target those responsible for 9/11. It has since been invoked to justify military action in 18 countries, against groups that did not exist in 2001, without further congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, the Treasury Department received emergency authority to stabilize the financial system. The Troubled Asset Relief Program was sold as temporary and extraordinary. Elements of that emergency authority have been extended and renewed for 15 years.</p>\n\n<p>Extraordinary becomes normal when we stop asking whether the initial justification still applies.</p>\n\n<p>The President's demand is framed as imperative security policy. But security for whom? Greenland already hosts Pituffik Space Base, operated jointly by the United States and Denmark under treaty. NORAD conducts routine operations there with Danish cooperation.</p>\n\n<p>The strategic access already exists. What is being demanded is not access but ownership.</p>\n\n<p>**What Citizens Should Ask**</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether Greenland has strategic value.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether the United States can use economic coercion to force a democratic ally to surrender sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then what principle constrains that power? If tariffs can be imposed until Denmark yields Greenland, can they be imposed until Norway yields Svalbard? Until Canada yields the Northwest Passage?</p>\n\n<p>Once sovereignty becomes negotiable through economic threat, what border is secure?</p>\n\n<p>The President has also stated he will not rule out military force. When pressed, he said \"no comment.\" That is not the same as saying no.</p>\n\n<p>In 1939, Germany demanded that Poland cede the Free City of Danzig and grant extraterritorial access through the Polish Corridor. The demand was framed as addressing legitimate security concerns and correcting historical injustices. Poland refused. War followed.</p>\n\n<p>I am not predicting war. I am noting that territorial demands backed by threats have a history. That history does not end well.</p>\n\n<p>**The Test of Principle**</p>\n\n<p>The United States was founded on the proposition that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. That principle is not merely domestic. It is the basis of the international order we built after 1945.</p>\n\n<p>That order has flaws. It has failed often. But it rests on the idea that nations do not simply take what they can, that borders are not merely facts of power, that sovereignty matters.</p>\n\n<p>If we abandon that principle when it becomes inconvenient, we abandon the only framework that prevents international relations from becoming purely a question of force.</p>\n\n<p>The European Union's foreign policy chief said it clearly: \"Sovereignty is not for trade.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is not defiance. That is a statement of the principle that makes peaceful coexistence possible.</p>\n\n<p>When the President imposes these tariffs on February 1st, as he has promised \"100%\" he will do, the question will not be whether European economies suffer. The question will be whether economic coercion in pursuit of territorial demands has become an acceptable tool of American statecraft.</p>\n\n<p>If it has, then we are no longer the nation that wrote the Atlantic Charter or designed the United Nations. We are something else.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether we can take Greenland. The test is whether we believe that power alone decides what is ours.</p>\n\n<p>That question, still unanswered, is why this moment matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I spent years in government service. I learned early that certain institutions exist not to make governing easier, but to make it harder in specific, necessary ways.</p>\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve is one of those institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Congress created it in 1913 after watching how politics and money interact when no barrier stands between them. The pattern was consistent: financial panics in the 1890s, political pressure for easy credit, economic collapse, repeat. The lesson was not complicated. When presidents can manipulate monetary policy for short-term political gain, the economy destabilizes in predictable ways.</p>\n\n<p>So Congress built a wall. Not an absolute wall, but a procedural one. Federal Reserve governors serve fixed terms. They can be removed for malfeasance, but not for disagreement. Not for setting interest rates the president dislikes. Not for pursuing policies that serve long-term stability over short-term popularity.</p>\n\n<p>That wall has held for 112 years.</p>\n\n<p>This week, the Supreme Court considers whether to demolish it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Argument Being Made</p>\n\n<p>The legal question appears narrow. President Trump seeks to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor appointed by President Biden. The stated cause: irregularities in mortgage applications for two properties. Cook denies wrongdoing. Her lawyers note that four Cabinet members and the deputy attorney general have made similar applications without prosecution. The official who raised the allegations, Bill Pulte, has relatives who did the same.</p>\n\n<p>But the narrow question hides a structural claim.</p>\n\n<p>The administration argues that once the president determines cause exists, that determination is unreviewable by courts. The president's judgment is final. No independent tribunal examines the evidence. No standard of proof applies. If the president says cause exists, cause exists.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about Lisa Cook's mortgages.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether \"for cause\" means anything at all.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen this move before, in different contexts. A legal protection remains on paper while its meaning gets hollowed out. The words stay the same. The substance vanishes. You still need \"cause\" to fire a Fed governor, technically. But cause becomes whatever the president says it is, whenever he says it, without review.</p>\n\n<p>That is not a protection. That is permission.</p>\n\n<p>## What Powell Said</p>\n\n<p>Jerome Powell, the Fed chair Trump himself appointed in 2018, is known for careful language and institutional deference. He avoided confrontation even as Trump publicly called him incompetent or crooked. He stayed quiet when the administration opened a criminal investigation into his Senate testimony about building renovations.</p>\n\n<p>Then Powell spoke clearly.</p>\n\n<p>\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of federal reserve buildings. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president.\"</p>\n\n<p>Powell used the word \"pretexts.\" That is the language of someone who has watched procedure become theater, who has seen legal mechanisms deployed not for their stated purpose but to achieve a different end.</p>\n\n<p>He is describing what happens when the question is not whether cause exists, but whether claiming cause is sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>## Why Congress Built the Wall</p>\n\n<p>The argument for presidential control has constitutional weight. Article II vests executive power in the president. Proponents argue he cannot execute that power if he cannot remove officials who resist his direction.</p>\n\n<p>But Congress has constitutional power too. Article I grants it authority to structure how government operates, including creating institutions that check executive discretion. The first Congress, which included many Founders, created the First Bank of the United States in 1791 with term-limited leadership precisely to insulate financial policy from direct presidential control.</p>\n\n<p>They had watched how monarchs manipulate currency. They understood that elected executives face the same temptations.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether the president has executive power. The question is whether that power extends to controlling monetary policy through personnel removal, when Congress specifically designed an institution to prevent that control.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Tarullo, a former Fed governor and Harvard law professor, explains the economic reality: \"Presidents of both parties always want interest rates to go down, particularly in election years, but that inevitably destabilizes the economy.\"</p>\n\n<p>When long-term rates rise because markets fear inflation, mortgages and business investment suffer. The political incentive is always for short-term stimulus. The economic necessity is often for long-term restraint. Congress created the Fed to resolve that tension by removing the decision from political calculation.</p>\n\n<p>If the president can fire Fed governors who resist his preferences, that resolution fails. The Fed becomes what it was designed not to be: an instrument of presidential economic policy.</p>\n\n<p>## The Normalization Pattern</p>\n\n<p>I am watching a familiar pattern unfold.</p>\n\n<p>First, you claim emergency authority for extraordinary circumstances. Then you find ordinary circumstances that arguably fit the emergency framework. Then the framework becomes routine. Then the exception becomes the rule.</p>\n\n<p>The administration is not arguing it can fire Fed governors at will. It is arguing it can fire them for cause, and that presidential determination of cause is unreviewable.</p>\n\n<p>But unreviewable determination is functionally equivalent to at-will removal. If I can fire you whenever I decide sufficient cause exists, and no one can challenge that decision, then I can fire you whenever I want. The \"for cause\" requirement becomes a formality, a box to check, not a constraint on power.</p>\n\n<p>Every living Fed chair except Powell has signed briefs opposing this change. Treasury secretaries from both parties have too. So have prominent economists across the political spectrum. Jamie Dimon, not known for alarmism, warns of \"reverse consequences\" including higher inflation and increased borrowing costs.</p>\n\n<p>These are not partisans defending bureaucratic turf. These are people who understand what happens when short-term political pressure drives monetary policy.</p>\n\n<p>## What the Court Said Before</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court, in recent emergency docket rulings, allowed Trump to remove other agency heads with term protections. But in one opinion, the conservative majority noted the Fed is different: \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"</p>\n\n<p>That distinction recognizes something important. Some institutions exist not to implement presidential policy but to constrain it. They are countermajoritarian by design, built to resist immediate political pressure in service of longer-term stability.</p>\n\n<p>The question before the Court is whether that distinction still holds. Whether the constitutional structure allows Congress to create institutions genuinely independent of direct presidential control, or whether Article II executive power ultimately subsumes everything.</p>\n\n<p>## The Question Citizens Should Ask</p>\n\n<p>This is not about whether Lisa Cook should be a Fed governor. This is not about whether Trump's economic policy preferences are sound. This is not even about whether the Federal Reserve as currently structured is the best possible design.</p>\n\n<p>This is about whether presidential power over monetary policy has effective limits.</p>\n\n<p>If the president can remove Fed governors by claiming cause and that claim is unreviewable, then future presidents inherit that power. A president who wants higher interest rates to fight inflation can fire governors who resist. A president who wants lower rates to stimulate growth can fire governors who disagree. The Fed becomes responsive to whoever holds office, not to any consistent standard or statutory mandate.</p>\n\n<p>The wall Congress built in 1913 was not meant to last forever unchanged. But it was meant to be removed deliberately, through legislation, not eroded through interpretations that preserve the form while eliminating the substance.</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing the president should never be able to remove Federal Reserve governors. I am arguing that if we change that 112-year-old protection, we should change it knowingly, through democratic process, not through legal claims that redefine \"cause\" until it means \"disagreement.\"</p>\n\n<p>Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush, is arguing this case for Cook and the Fed's independence. Powell himself will be in the courtroom. That tells you something about what people who have served, across administrations, understand about what is at stake.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether the president wants compliant officials. Every president does.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether monetary policy should be insulated from that desire, and whether Congress has authority to create that insulation.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to that question shapes whether we have independent institutions, or whether we have institutions that answer to whoever currently holds power.</p>\n\n<p>That question, framed clearly, is why this moment matters.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I served in the uniformed services. I worked in government agencies where oversight existed, where inspectors general mattered, where the line between the White House and prosecutorial power was not crossed because it could not be crossed without consequences.</p>\n\n<p>That line has now been crossed. Repeatedly. Openly.</p>\n\n<p>The NPR report catalogs what has happened in one year. The catalog itself is the problem. When you need a multi-section graphic essay to track the erosion of constitutional norms, you are no longer talking about policy disputes. You are talking about a different kind of government.</p>\n\n<p>This is not about partisan alignment. This is about whether the system designed in Philadelphia in 1787 can withstand a presidency that treats its constraints as suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>## The Architecture Assumed Restraint</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution did not anticipate a president who would fire inspectors general for doing their jobs. It did not envision a Justice Department weaponized against political opponents while the president announces his targets on social media. It did not plan for congressional majorities that would watch the executive branch seize spending authority, implement sweeping tariffs without meaningful legislative debate, and respond with silence.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders built a system of checks and balances. What they assumed, but could not guarantee, was that people in power would fear violating those checks.</p>\n\n<p>That fear is gone.</p>\n\n<p>When a president pardons those convicted of violently attacking the Capitol, he is not merely exercising constitutional authority. He is declaring that political loyalty supersedes the rule of law. When his administration defies court orders, intimidates journalists, and threatens prosecutors who investigate allies, he is testing whether the system will enforce its own rules.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the answer has been equivocal.</p>\n\n<p>## Normalization Is the Danger</p>\n\n<p>What makes this moment dangerous is not any single act. It is the speed at which the extraordinary becomes ordinary.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, the idea that the president would openly direct prosecutions of political enemies would have been unthinkable. Now it is reported as fact, cataloged alongside other actions, and the news cycle moves on.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, the systematic dismantling of public health institutions based on a cabinet secretary's personal theories would have triggered congressional investigations. Now it is policy.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, Congress would not have tolerated the executive branch unilaterally withholding appropriated funds. Now it happens, and the legislative branch shrugs.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics slip. Not through a single coup. Through a thousand small adjustments in what is considered acceptable. Through the quiet recalibration of what \"checks and balances\" means until it means very little at all.</p>\n\n<p>## The Founders Warned Us</p>\n\n<p>Madison wrote in Federalist 51: \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>The system was designed for people who would seek power and misuse it. What the Founders could not fully account for was a scenario where one branch of government would actively assist another in dismantling the controls meant to restrain them both.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether President Trump is popular with his base. The question is whether popularity justifies the systematic elimination of accountability mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Lincoln faced a genuine existential crisis, a civil war that threatened the nation's survival. Even then, he submitted to judicial review, accepted the legitimacy of elections during wartime, and defended the principle that no president is above the law. His suspension of habeas corpus was contested in court, debated in Congress, and ultimately constrained.</p>\n\n<p>What we face now is not a civil war. It is a claim that electoral victory grants authority to disregard institutional constraints whenever they prove inconvenient. That is not a muscular presidency. That is something else.</p>\n\n<p>## The Test Is Here</p>\n\n<p>The question citizens should be asking is this: What happens when the system designed to check power assumes that those in power will respect its legitimacy?</p>\n\n<p>We are finding out.</p>\n\n<p>Federal judges issue orders. The administration ignores them. Congress holds the purse. The executive branch withholds funds anyway. Inspectors general investigate. They are fired. Journalists report. They are threatened. Scientists provide data. They are silenced.</p>\n\n<p>Each act alone might be debated on its merits. Taken together, they form a pattern. That pattern is not compatible with a government of laws.</p>\n\n<p>The midterm elections will matter. Whether Congress reasserts its constitutional role will matter. Whether courts enforce their orders will matter. Whether citizens demand accountability will matter.</p>\n\n<p>But what matters most is whether we recognize what is happening while it is happening. Whether we see the difference between legitimate policy disputes and the systematic dismantling of the mechanisms that make self-government possible.</p>\n\n<p>The architecture of the republic is still standing. The question is whether anyone is still willing to defend it.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why we must answer it now.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",
