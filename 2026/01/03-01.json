Explosions were reported in the capital.  A state of emergency was declared.  The essential elements of invasion were present and visible.</p>\n\n<p>What followed was not confusion, but adjustment.</p>\n\n<p>The act was quickly reframed as an “operation.”  The removal of a foreign leader became a “capture.”  The use of armed force against another state’s political authority was discussed in terms of execution and aftermath rather than legitimacy.  The language shrank the event, not because its nature was unclear, but because its implications were inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>This is the danger.</p>\n\n<p>Free societies do not collapse because force is used.  They collapse when the use of force is processed, when acts that once demanded collective authorization and moral reckoning are instead absorbed into routine executive action.  Power becomes most corrosive not when it is dramatic, but when it is handled administratively.</p>\n\n<p>An invasion is not defined by how long troops remain, how precise the weapons are, or how cleanly objectives are achieved.  It is defined by the use of armed force to coerce another state’s political independence.  That definition does not change because the announcement is brief, the justification deferred, or the language softened.</p>\n\n<p>War powers exist for a reason older than any modern doctrine: because offensive force alters the relationship between the state and its citizens.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it.  It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the Legislature.”</p><cite>— James Madison, <em>Letter to Thomas Jefferson, April 2, 1798</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>When such force is initiated without prior authorization, consent is no longer sought, it is assumed retroactively.  Citizens are not asked to judge the action before it occurs; they are asked to accept it once it is done.</p>\n\n<p>International restraint functions the same way.  The prohibition on using force against another state’s sovereignty is not aspirational.  It exists to prevent precedent from replacing law.  Once a powerful nation demonstrates that it may remove another government’s leadership unilaterally and survive the act politically, the constraint is no longer binding.  It becomes optional.</p>\n\n<p>This is how norms die. Not with outrage, but with procedural adjustment.</p>\n\n<p>What matters is not whether this action is later justified, ratified, or normalized through explanation.  What matters is that it occurred first, and was debated second.  That sequence is the breach.</p>\n\n<p>The implications do not remain abroad.</p>\n\n<p>A government that grows accustomed to acting first and accounting later in foreign affairs inevitably imports that logic home.  The tools are identical: urgency, secrecy, obedience, and retrospective justification.  The habit of unchecked action does not respect borders.  Liberty erodes not because it is directly attacked, but because restraint is no longer reflexive.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a question of outcomes.  It is a question of thresholds.</p>\n\n<p>If the removal of a foreign head of state by force can be announced, defended, and administratively processed without prior authorization or immediate institutional resistance, then the line that once made such acts extraordinary has already failed.</p>\n\n<p>When invasion becomes administrative, restraint becomes optional. When restraint becomes optional, law becomes decorative.</p>\n\n<p>A republic does not lose its character when it faces danger. It loses it when extraordinary power is exercised without pause, and treated as normal.</p>\n\n<p>Silence in such moments is not neutrality. It is instruction.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“A silent acquiescence in the decisions of power is the ruin of liberty.”</p><cite>— John Dickinson, <em>Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, 1767​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</em></cite></blockquote>",
