The end rarely announces itself.  It settles in.</p>\n\n<p>A republic does not need to be seized if it can be hollowed out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Myth of the Sudden Collapse</strong></p>\n\n<p>We imagine the fall of free societies as loud events: tanks in the streets, legislatures stormed, constitutions torn up in public view.</p>\n\n<p>That is not how it usually happens.</p>\n\n<p>More often, the forms remain.  Elections still occur.  Courts still convene.  Offices still operate.  What changes is not the structure, but the substance.</p>\n\n<p>Power becomes less answerable. Rights become more conditional. Silence becomes safer than speech.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing is abolished.  Everything is adjusted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Habituation Is the Real Threat</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine understood that people can adapt to almost anything, including diminished liberty.</p>\n\n<p>What begins as an exception becomes precedent.  What begins as shocking becomes routine.  Each step is small enough to be rationalized.  Each adjustment is framed as necessary, responsible, temporary.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, citizens stop asking whether something is acceptable and begin asking only whether it is normal.</p>\n\n<p>That shift is fatal.</p>\n\n<p>A people who normalize diminished liberty will not notice when it is gone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Forms Without Force</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of Paine's sharpest insights was that tyranny does not require lawlessness.</p>\n\n<p>A system can follow procedures while betraying principles.  It can obey the letter of the law while violating its purpose.  It can preserve institutions while draining them of independence.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics die politely.</p>\n\n<p>The machinery continues to move, but it no longer responds to the public.  Accountability becomes performative.  Oversight becomes ceremonial.  Power remains, but consent fades.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why People Don't Resist</strong></p>\n\n<p>The question is often asked later: Why didn't they stop it?</p>\n\n<p>Paine would have recognized the answer.</p>\n\n<p>There is no single moment that demands resistance.  No clear line where liberty obviously ends.  Instead, there is a series of compromises, each individually defensible, collectively devastating.</p>\n\n<p>People wait for a clearer signal.  They assume someone else will act.  They tell themselves it is not yet bad enough.</p>\n\n<p>By the time it is undeniable, the tools for resistance are often gone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Comfort of Continuity</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the great strengths of republics is continuity.  But continuity can become a liability when it masks decay.</p>\n\n<p>As long as daily life continues, jobs, schools, markets, routines, people assume the system endures.  They confuse personal stability with political health.</p>\n\n<p>Paine warned against this complacency.  He knew that liberty could vanish without immediately disrupting ordinary life.</p>\n\n<p>A people can remain comfortable long after they have ceased to be free.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Silence That Precedes the End</strong></p>\n\n<p>The final stage is not violence. It is quiet.</p>\n\n<p>Not enforced silence, at first, but chosen silence.  Self-censorship.  Withdrawal.  Caution.  The sense that speaking is risky and unlikely to matter.</p>\n\n<p>When enough people decide it is safer to stay silent than to object, the republic has already crossed its most dangerous threshold.</p>\n\n<p>Paine understood that tyranny does not require universal support.</p>\n\n<p>It requires only widespread resignation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Paine Was Really Warning About</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Common Sense</em> was not merely an argument for independence from Britain.</p>\n\n<p>It was a warning about what happens when people grow accustomed to power that no longer justifies itself.</p>\n\n<p>Paine believed that liberty survives only when citizens remain unwilling to accept authority on autopilot, when they continue to ask hard questions even when doing so is uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>Especially then.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Question That Determines the Outcome</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine forced his readers to confront a question that still matters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>At what point does obedience become habit rather than choice?</blockquote>\n\n<p>A republic survives only as long as obedience remains voluntary, rooted in consent, sustained by accountability, and constrained by law.</p>\n\n<p>When obedience becomes reflexive, liberty is already fading.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Ending Is Not Inevitable</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine was not a prophet of despair.  He believed decline could be arrested, if people recognized it while recognition still mattered.</p>\n\n<p>The loss of a republic is not a moment. It is a process.</p>\n\n<p>And processes can be interrupted.</p>\n\n<p>But only by citizens who refuse to confuse continuity with legitimacy, order with justice, or silence with peace.</p>\n\n<p>A republic is not overthrown when it ends.</p>\n\n<p>It is outgrown by power, and outwaited by the people.</p>",
