Power that governs by consent does not need to intimidate.  Power that fears resistance reaches for weapons long before it reaches for explanation.</p>\n\n<p>A government that turns its coercive tools inward is telling the truth about itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Force Is the Language of Fear</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine lived under an empire that justified its rule with soldiers.  British troops were not stationed in the colonies because the Crown trusted the colonists.  They were there because it did not.</p>\n\n<p>That lesson mattered.</p>\n\n<p>When authority relies increasingly on armed presence, tactical language, and coercive posture in civilian life, it signals a shift in priorities.  Persuasion gives way to control.  Legitimacy gives way to enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>Force is efficient. Consent is slower.</p>\n\n<p>Governments that prefer speed choose force.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Militarization Is a Substitute for Legitimacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine recognized that standing power, especially power deployed internally, fills a vacuum left by lost trust.</p>\n\n<p>A confident government tolerates criticism.  It absorbs dissent.  It argues.  It persuades.  An insecure one suppresses, deters, and preempts.</p>\n\n<p>The presence of armed authority in civil spaces is not neutral.  It reshapes behavior, narrows acceptable speech, and reframes citizenship as compliance.</p>\n\n<p>When the governed are treated as potential threats, the social contract has already been breached.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Order Is Not the Same as Liberty</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every expansion of internal force is justified as maintaining order.</p>\n\n<p>Paine would have asked a simpler question: order for whom?</p>\n\n<p>Order imposed by fear is not peace.  It is quiet.  And quiet can coexist comfortably with injustice.  A population can be orderly while being oppressed, compliant while being stripped of agency.</p>\n\n<p>Liberty, by contrast, is noisy.  It argues.  It resists.  It refuses to be perfectly managed.</p>\n\n<p>A government that prioritizes order above liberty has already chosen control over consent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Dangerous Blur Between Defense and Domination</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine drew a sharp line between defending a nation and governing it.</p>\n\n<p>Military force exists to repel external threats.  When that force is normalized internally, when domestic issues are framed as battles, opponents as enemies, and governance as operations, the line collapses.</p>\n\n<p>Once collapsed, everything becomes tactical.  Every problem demands force.  Every disagreement becomes a threat.</p>\n\n<p>This is how republics learn to see their own people as territory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Free Governments Fear Standing Power</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine distrusted standing armies not because soldiers are immoral, but because force obeys command, not conscience.</p>\n\n<p>A government accustomed to solving problems through armed authority will eventually use it wherever resistance appears.  Not always violently.  Sometimes symbolically.  Sometimes selectively.  Sometimes \"just to send a message.\"</p>\n\n<p>The message is always the same: power no longer needs permission.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Psychological Shift</strong></p>\n\n<p>Militarization changes more than posture.  It changes expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Citizens begin to self-censor.  Public space narrows.  Dissent feels riskier, not because it is illegal, but because the cost of being noticed rises.</p>\n\n<p>This is not accidental.  It is how coercion works without constant violence.</p>\n\n<p>Paine would have recognized the warning signs immediately.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When Force Replaces Explanation</strong></p>\n\n<p>The most telling moment is not when force is used, but when it becomes the default response.</p>\n\n<p>When authorities stop explaining decisions and start enforcing them, legitimacy has been traded for efficiency.  Debate becomes delay.  Questions become obstacles.  Transparency becomes vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p>Force is simpler than persuasion. That is why it is tempting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Question Paine Would Ask</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine would not ask whether force is lawful.</p>\n\n<p>He would ask why it is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>A government that must routinely rely on armed power to manage its own people has already lost something essential: trust.</p>\n\n<p>And trust, once gone, cannot be restored at gunpoint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What a Republic Requires</strong></p>\n\n<p>A republic does not require weakness. It requires restraint.</p>\n\n<p>It requires confidence that its authority can withstand disagreement without intimidation.  It requires leaders who believe that citizens are participants, not adversaries.</p>\n\n<p>Paine believed that the moment a government begins to fear its people, liberty is already in retreat.</p>\n\n<p>Power that turns its weapons inward has forgotten who it serves.</p>",
