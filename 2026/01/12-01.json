  "content": "<p><strong>Writs of Assistance</strong></p>\n\n<p>Before the American Revolution, British authorities relied on <em>writs of assistance</em> - open-ended search authorities that allowed officers to move <em>house to house</em> in search of contraband or suspects.  They were not limited to named individuals or specific addresses. Entire neighborhoods were treated as investigatory space.</p>\n\n<p>The harm lay in generality, not brutality. Once every home could be searched, none were secure.</p>\n\n<p>House-to-house enforcement based on status, suspicion, or convenience, rather than individualized cause, was understood as incompatible with liberty.  That practice was one of the direct causes of the Revolution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is happening now</strong></p>\n\n<p>Federal immigration agents have begun <em>door-to-door residential operations</em> in Minneapolis–St. Paul.  Community alerts and legal observers report <em>systematic home visits</em> - multiple houses in sequence, not isolated encounters.</p>\n\n<p>Agents are knocking, identifying themselves as federal law enforcement, and requesting occupants open their doors.  In some cases, they are displaying <em>ICE administrative warrants</em>, documents not signed by judges - they are not search warrants and <em>do not authorize entry into a home without consent.</em></p>\n\n<p>Constitutional violation does not begin at the threshold. It begins when the door-to-door pattern emerges.</p>\n\n<p>A single knock can be described as voluntary. A <em>programmatic door-to-door operation cannot.</em></p>\n\n<p>When homes are canvassed rather than approached for named individuals at known addresses, the home ceases to function as a protected boundary and becomes part of the search itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The governing text</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Fourth Amendment was written to prevent exactly this shift:</p>\n\n<p>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”</p>\n\n<p>What the Constitution forbids is generality. Generalized enforcement was the abuse the Amendment was designed to stop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What this means now</strong></p>\n\n<p>The government has crossed a constitutional line. That fact alone now carries no automatic consequence.</p>\n\n<p>The action is unlawful on paper, but nothing follows unless a branch of government chooses to enforce the limit.  The violation exists as a record, not a restraint.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“A man’s house is his castle; and whilst he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle.”</p><cite>— James Otis, <em>Argument Against Writs of Assistance (1761)</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Door-to-door federal enforcement is not routine policing.</em> It is a constitutional event, whether or not anyone treats it as one.</p>\n\n<p>The question is no longer what the Constitution says. It is whether anyone is still willing to enforce it.</p>",
