When rights are violated, judges intervene.  When power overreaches, rulings correct the error.  When law is ignored, legality is restored.</p>\n\n<p>That confidence rests on a fragile assumption.  That justice arrives in time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Time Lag No One Accounts For</strong></p>\n\n<p>Executive power moves quickly.  Elections move on fixed schedules.  Courts move deliberately.</p>\n\n<p>This mismatch is not a flaw.  It is a design choice, meant to ensure careful judgment.  But in moments of crisis, delay becomes vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p>When harm occurs during an election, intimidation, disruption, suppression, confusion, there is no pause button.  Ballots are cast or not cast.  Lines form or disperse.  Voters decide whether the risk is worth it.</p>\n\n<p>By the time a case is filed, the damage is already done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Relief That Arrives Too Late</strong></p>\n\n<p>Courts are excellent at declaring what should not have happened.  They are far less capable of undoing what already has.</p>\n\n<p>A ruling weeks later can affirm that voters were wrongly deterred.  It cannot restore the votes never cast.  It cannot recreate the conditions of confidence that were lost.  It cannot compel participation retroactively.</p>\n\n<p>Legal vindication does not equal democratic repair.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Illusion of Reversibility</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a comforting belief that if an election is compromised, it can simply be redone.  That belief misunderstands how legitimacy works.</p>\n\n<p>Elections are singular events.  Their authority comes from timing and acceptance, not from repetition.  Once results are certified and power is exercised, even temporarily, reversal becomes destabilizing rather than corrective.</p>\n\n<p>Courts understand this.  That is why remedies after elections are narrow, cautious, and rare.</p>\n\n<p>The system is designed to preserve continuity, not remember what might have been.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Process Matters More Than Outcome</strong></p>\n\n<p>Democracy depends less on who wins than on whether the loss is accepted.  Acceptance depends on belief that participation was meaningful and fair.</p>\n\n<p>If voters believe the process was distorted by force or fear, outcomes lose legitimacy regardless of margins.  Even correct legal rulings cannot restore trust once it has been withdrawn.</p>\n\n<p>That erosion is permanent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Strategic Value of Delay</strong></p>\n\n<p>Delay does not have to be malicious to be effective.  It only has to be predictable.</p>\n\n<p>When those exercising power know that judicial review will arrive after the decisive moment, they can act aggressively without immediate consequence.  Even adverse rulings later become manageable.  Damage is absorbed.  Positions harden.  New facts replace old ones.</p>\n\n<p>This is not lawlessness.  It is law used against time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why This Is the Real Risk</strong></p>\n\n<p>The greatest danger to constitutional government is not overt defiance of the courts.  It is compliance that arrives after relevance.</p>\n\n<p>A system where rights are always vindicated too late is indistinguishable, in practice, from a system where rights do not exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>Paper protection without temporal protection is not a safeguard.  It is a memorial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Liberty Requires</strong></p>\n\n<p>Liberty depends on restraint exercised before harm, not correction afterward.  It depends on institutions that refuse to cross lines rather than litigate them later.  It depends on officials who recognize that legality delayed can become legitimacy denied.</p>\n\n<p>Courts remain essential.  But they are not enough.</p>\n\n<p>If constitutional protections are invoked only after the polls close, they arrive not as defense, but as epitaph.</p>",
