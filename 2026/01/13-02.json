  "content": "<p>I wore the uniform for twenty years. I know what operational authority looks like, and I know what occupation looks like.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in Minneapolis is not law enforcement. It is occupation.</p>\n\n<p>More than 2,000 federal agents have deployed to a single metropolitan area. They are stopping people in parking lots. They are questioning drivers at charging stations. They are rear-ending vehicles and demanding papers. They are using tear gas on protesters outside high schools. They are conducting what the Vice President himself describes as door-to-door operations.</p>\n\n<p>A woman was shot and killed blocking a road.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government says this is immigration enforcement. Minnesota officials say it is unconstitutional. Both cannot be right about what authority means in a republic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Question of Reasonable Suspicion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures. The Department of Homeland Security says its agents operate under \"reasonable suspicion\" as protected by the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what reasonable suspicion meant in Minneapolis on Monday, according to NPR reporters who witnessed it: A permanent resident named Joel Keleekai was charging his Tesla when Border Patrol agents approached and questioned him. Other drivers at the charging station were also questioned. All of them were people of color. All were able to prove legal status.</p>\n\n<p>Another man, identified only as M.A., a U.S. citizen originally from Somalia, was briefly detained on his way to work and questioned about his immigration status.</p>\n\n<p>A couple, Christian and Lorena Molina, both U.S. citizens, were pursued by federal agents after Christian made eye contact with them. The agents rear-ended his vehicle. They demanded his identification. He refused to provide it except to local police. The agents ran his plates and left.</p>\n\n<p>The government claims these stops were not random. That federal law enforcement does not \"execute operations without undergoing proper procedure, such as securing warrants when necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>That statement raises more questions than it answers.</p>\n\n<p>If these were not random stops, what specific reasonable suspicion justified questioning every person of color at a charging station? What intelligence led agents to pursue a U.S. citizen because he looked at them? What warrant authorized rear-ending a vehicle to demand papers?</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution does not permit law enforcement to patrol neighborhoods demanding proof of citizenship from people who look foreign. It does not permit mass operations based on demographic profiling. It does not permit treating entire communities as presumptively suspect.</p>\n\n<p>Unless it does now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When Enforcement Becomes Presence</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a difference between targeted law enforcement and sustained federal presence. One addresses specific violations. The other establishes control.</p>\n\n<p>The administration describes this as an immigration crackdown. But immigration enforcement, traditionally, has been targeted. Agents had specific information about specific individuals. They conducted operations, made arrests, and left.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in Minneapolis does not follow that pattern. More than 2,000 agents have deployed to the region. That number is expected to increase. They are conducting patrols. They are engaging in roving stops. They are going door to door. The Vice President announced this publicly as policy.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a surge. It is a deployment.</p>\n\n<p>The distinction matters. A surge addresses a crisis and withdraws. A deployment establishes presence. One is temporary and targeted. The other is sustained and diffuse.</p>\n\n<p>When federal forces establish sustained presence in American cities, when they patrol neighborhoods and demand papers, when they treat entire populations as subjects for investigation, the question is not whether they have legal authority to be there.</p>\n\n<p>The question is what kind of country permits that to be normal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Normalization of Extraordinary Powers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison filed suit alleging that federal agents have arrested peaceful bystanders, detained U.S. citizens, and fired chemical irritants at protesters exercising First Amendment rights. The suit alleges racial profiling. It asks a federal court to end the operation.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration says it has \"the Constitution on our side\" and looks forward to proving it in court.</p>\n\n<p>Both positions assume that what is happening is a legal question.</p>\n\n<p>It is not only a legal question. It is a question about what we permit authority to become.</p>\n\n<p>The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches. The question is what \"unreasonable\" means when federal agents can patrol neighborhoods, question people in parking lots, and demand papers based on appearance. Does the amendment protect people if the government can simply deploy enough agents to make mass stops routine?</p>\n\n<p>The First Amendment protects the right to protest. The question is what that right means when federal agents deploy tear gas outside high schools. Does the amendment protect expression if the government can make exercising it dangerous?</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution protects citizens from arbitrary detention. The question is what protection means when a U.S. citizen can be stopped, questioned, and forced to prove citizenship while going to work. Does the Constitution protect status if proving that status becomes a daily requirement?</p>\n\n<p>These are not hypotheticals. They happened Monday in Minneapolis. They are happening today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What History Shows</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, limiting the federal government's use of military forces for domestic law enforcement. The principle was simple: a republic does not use its military to police its own people.</p>\n\n<p>The law has exceptions. Federal forces can be deployed in specific circumstances, with specific limitations. But the principle remains: domestic law enforcement is the province of civilian authorities, constrained by constitutional limits, answerable to local communities.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in Minneapolis does not violate the letter of Posse Comitatus. These are not military forces. They are federal law enforcement agents operating under immigration authority.</p>\n\n<p>But the deployment follows the form of military occupation. Federal forces in armored vehicles. Masked agents conducting patrols. Roving stops. Checkpoints without location. Demand for papers without probable cause. Door-to-door operations. Tear gas against protesters.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether immigration enforcement is legal. The question is whether mass federal presence in American cities, operating with the tactics of occupation, is compatible with constitutional government.</p>\n\n<p>History suggests it is not. Not in a free society. Not for long.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Test</strong></p>\n\n<p>Minnesota and Illinois filed lawsuits Monday. Chicago joined Minnesota in alleging constitutional violations. Both jurisdictions seek to halt operations they describe as militarized raids violating the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n\n<p>The cases will proceed. Courts will rule on whether the operations violate specific constitutional provisions. Legal questions will be answered through legal process.</p>\n\n<p>But beneath the legal questions lies a deeper one: What does it mean when federal authority can deploy thousands of agents to American cities, patrol neighborhoods, stop people based on appearance, demand papers without warrants, and treat entire communities as operational zones?</p>\n\n<p>Is that immigration enforcement? Or is it something else?</p>\n\n<p>The administration says it is enforcing the law. State officials say it is violating the Constitution. Residents describe fear. A woman is dead.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is happening now, in an American city, under claim of lawful authority.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not what courts decide. The test is what we accept.</p>\n\n<p>When federal forces patrol American streets demanding papers, when they stop citizens based on appearance, when they conduct operations that treat entire communities as suspect populations, when they respond to protest with chemical weapons, the question is not whether they have the authority to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether a free people permit that authority to exist.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why Minneapolis matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",
