  "content": "<p><strong>A series on power, resistance, and the narrowing edge of liberty</strong></p>\n\n<p>This series begins from a simple observation.  Power does not announce its limits.  It discovers them.</p>\n\n<p>In a constitutional republic, those limits exist at the perimeter, the places where authority meets resistance, where law is tested against dissent, and where compliance is no longer assumed.  Historically, that edge has been guarded by federalism, elections, protest, and accountability.  When those defenses weaken, power does not surge inward all at once.  It probes.  It pressures.  It reframes.</p>\n\n<p>What follows is an examination of that process as it is unfolding now.</p>\n\n<p>Each essay in The Perimeter takes a single step in a larger argument.  We begin with data, with where crime and immigration pressures actually are, and where they are not.  We move through selective enforcement, rhetorical escalation, emergency authority, immunity, and finally the consequences for democratic participation itself.  No single piece claims collapse.  Together, they trace how erosion occurs without formal rupture.</p>\n\n<p>The title reflects the question at the heart of the series.  Not whether power exists, but where it is willing to stop.</p>\n\n<p>James Gillray’s The American Rattle Snake hangs over the series as both warning and reminder.  The rattlesnake does not strike without provocation.  It signals first.  In the eighteenth century, that image represented a young republic asserting its right to be left alone.  In the twenty-first, it asks a harder question.  What happens when the warning is ignored, and the perimeter is crossed?</p>\n\n<p>Read individually, they are essays.  Read together, they are a map of how liberty narrows, not by decree, but by pressure applied at the edge.</p>\n\n<p><em>On Liberty</em></p>",
