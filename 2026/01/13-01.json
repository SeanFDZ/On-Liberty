  "content": "<p>One of the most enduring political myths is that good outcomes depend on good people.</p>\n\n<p>It is comforting.  It absolves systems of responsibility.  If things go wrong, we can blame character.  If things go right, we can credit virtue.  But comfort is not design, and Thomas Paine understood that better than most.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>Common Sense</em>, Paine was unsparing in his assessment of human nature.  He did not believe republics survive because leaders are wise or moral.  He believed they survive because power is constrained as if leaders will someday be neither.</p>\n\n<p>That assumption is not cynicism. It is architecture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Virtue Is an Unsafe Foundation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paine described government as a necessary evil, not because it is inherently corrupt, but because it exists to manage corruption that inevitably appears.</p>\n\n<p>A system that functions only when leaders behave well is not a system.  It is a wager.</p>\n\n<p>History is full of well-intentioned rulers who believed themselves indispensable, uniquely capable, or divinely justified.  Many began with restraint.  Few ended with it.</p>\n\n<p>The founders did not design a republic to reward virtue.  They designed one to survive ambition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When Norms Become the Guardrails</strong></p>\n\n<p>Modern governance often relies less on law than on custom: norms, traditions, good faith, restraint.  These are useful, until they are not.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with norms is that they are voluntary.</p>\n\n<p>Paine understood that unwritten rules are only as strong as the character of those who choose to follow them.  The moment a leader decides norms are optional, the system reveals whether it was built on law or on trust.</p>\n\n<p>If institutions collapse the instant someone refuses to play fair, the failure is not personal.  It is structural.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power Tests Systems, Not Souls</strong></p>\n\n<p>In times of stress, societies often ask the wrong question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Is this leader good?</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paine asked a better one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>What happens if the leader is not?</blockquote>\n\n<p>A republic that depends on decency to function will not survive indecency.  A constitution that assumes restraint will be defeated by ambition.  This is why Paine distrusted concentrated power, not because it always corrupts, but because it eventually invites those who will exploit it.</p>\n\n<p>Good people do not make bad systems safe. Bad people reveal whether good systems exist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Danger of Personalized Governance</strong></p>\n\n<p>When political authority becomes identified with an individual rather than an office, loyalty shifts from principle to personality.</p>\n\n<p>Paine saw this clearly in monarchy.  We are less willing to see it in modern forms.</p>\n\n<p>Once governance depends on trusting who holds power rather than limiting what power can do, accountability dissolves.  Criticism becomes personal.  Opposition becomes suspect.  And institutions become extensions of will.</p>\n\n<p>A republic is not designed to be run by heroes.  It is designed to endure administrators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why \"Trust Me\" Is Not a Safeguard</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every expansion of unchecked authority is justified the same way: trust.</p>\n\n<p>Trust the intentions. Trust the urgency. Trust that this exception will not become precedent.</p>\n\n<p>Paine rejected this logic outright.  Trust, he argued, belongs between citizens, not between the governed and concentrated power.  The entire purpose of constitutional limits is to remove trust from the equation.</p>\n\n<p>Where trust is required for liberty to survive, liberty is already at risk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Structural Failure Looks Like</strong></p>\n\n<p>When systems depend on virtue, warning signs appear quickly:</p>\n\n<p>- Laws enforced unevenly - Oversight treated as hostility - Power justified by personality rather than principle - Institutions bending instead of resisting</p>\n\n<p>These are not moral failures.  They are engineering failures.</p>\n\n<p>Paine would not have been surprised.  He assumed ambition.  He planned for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Hard Truth Paine Understood</strong></p>\n\n<p>A republic worthy of the name must be able to withstand the worst leader it can legally produce.</p>\n\n<p>If it cannot, then the problem is not who holds power today, but what power is allowed to exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>Paine did not ask citizens to believe in perfect leaders. He asked them to build systems that do not require them.</p>\n\n<p>That lesson remains unfinished.</p>",
