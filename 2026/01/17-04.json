  "content": "<p>I served in government long enough to know how power moves, how it tests boundaries, how it transforms means into ends. What we're witnessing in Minneapolis isn't merely federal immigration enforcement.  It's a stress test of constitutional architecture, conducted with tear gas and funding threats.</p>\n\n<p>The facts are straightforward. Federal agents surge into cities. A civilian is killed. Protests erupt. The administration threatens to invoke the Insurrection Act and simultaneously announces it will cut funding to cities that don't cooperate with its enforcement agenda.  The method is familiar: create crisis, demand submission, punish resistance.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't about immigration policy. This is about whether the federal government can commandeer state and local governments through financial coercion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Constitutional Architecture</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Founders designed a system of dual sovereignty. James Madison explained it clearly in Federalist 45: <em>\"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined.  Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>That division wasn't accidental. It was structural, deliberate, essential. The federal government enforces immigration law. States and cities run their own police departments, make their own public safety decisions, answer to their own voters. The Constitution does not permit Washington to conscript local law enforcement into federal service, nor to punish states financially for declining to assist.</p>\n\n<p>Courts have repeatedly affirmed this principle. In Printz v. United States (1997), the Supreme Court struck down federal attempts to commandeer state officers. The anti-commandeering doctrine holds that Congress cannot compel states to enforce federal law. The logic is simple: if Washington could force states to implement federal policy, the division of sovereignty would collapse. States would become administrative units, not sovereign governments.</p>\n\n<p>The spending power cases are equally clear. South Dakota v. Dole (1987) established that Congress can attach conditions to federal funding, but those conditions must relate to the purpose of the funds and cannot be so coercive that they amount to compulsion. In NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), the Court found that threatening to withhold all Medicaid funding unless states expanded the program crossed the line into unconstitutional coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Judge William Orrick's ruling blocking the Trump administration's sanctuary city funding threats follows directly from this precedent. The federal government cannot use money as a cudgel to force states to abandon their own policies. That's not federalism. That's subjugation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Local Cooperation Matters</strong></p>\n\n<p>The administration's frustration is understandable on operational grounds. ICE operated more efficiently when it could pick up individuals already in custody at local jails. Detainer requests,federal holds on individuals about to be released from local custody,streamlined the process.</p>\n\n<p>But efficiency isn't a constitutional argument.</p>\n\n<p>Local jurisdictions adopted sanctuary policies for reasons rooted in their own governance responsibilities. Police chiefs and mayors argued that cooperation with federal immigration enforcement undermined community trust, making immigrant communities reluctant to report crimes or cooperate with investigations. They concluded that their public safety mission required them to separate local policing from federal immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>Those are legitimate policy judgments. Citizens can disagree with them, can vote officials out who make them, can change state law to require cooperation. What citizens cannot do, what the federal government cannot do, is override state sovereignty through financial threats.</p>\n\n<p>The administration's response reveals the deeper problem. When state and local governments make decisions Washington dislikes, the federal playbook increasingly involves federal occupation (surge operations), federal prosecution (investigations of governors and mayors), and federal coercion (funding threats). Each step moves power from diffused to centralized, from accountable to distant, from constitutional order to executive will.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Pattern That Should Concern Us</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've seen this pattern before. An administration identifies a problem. Congress won't or can't act. The executive branch finds authorities, some legitimate, some stretched, some simply asserted, to act unilaterally. Opposition is framed as obstruction. Cooperation is demanded. Resistance is punished.</p>\n\n<p>The mechanisms vary but the trajectory is consistent: concentration of power, erosion of limitations, normalization of the extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Consider what's happening simultaneously in Minnesota: - Federal agents deploying tear gas against protesters - A Justice Department investigation of state and local officials - Threats to invoke the Insurrection Act - Promises to cut federal funding - Military personnel operating alongside civilian law enforcement</p>\n\n<p>Each element, taken alone, might have a technical legal justification. Collectively, they represent something else: a demonstration of federal dominance, a warning to other jurisdictions, a redefinition of the relationship between Washington and everywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>This is how federalism dies—not in a single dramatic breach, but through accumulated pressure, through crises real and manufactured, through the transformation of cooperation into compulsion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Question We Should Be Asking</strong></p>\n\n<p>The debate has focused on immigration enforcement and sanctuary policies. Those are important questions. But they're not the fundamental question.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental question is this: Can the federal government force state and local governments to implement federal policy by threatening their financial survival?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, then federalism is dead. State sovereignty becomes administrative convenience. Local control becomes federal permission. The constitutional architecture collapses into a unitary system with power flowing in one direction, downward from Washington.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood this danger. Hamilton warned in Federalist 17 that the states would be <em>\"constituent and essential parts of the federal government\"</em> whose independence must be preserved. Madison argued in Federalist 46 that state governments could <em>\"effectually oppose\"</em> federal overreach through <em>\"a refusal to cooperate with officers of the Union.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>That's not obstruction. That's constitutional design working as intended.</p>\n\n<p>When Washington attempts to override state resistance through funding coercion, it's not enforcing the law. It's rewriting the constitutional settlement, replacing dual sovereignty with federal supremacy, replacing political accountability with administrative compliance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What This Means</strong></p>\n\n<p>Courts will sort out the immediate legal questions. Judges have already blocked similar funding threats. They likely will again. The anti-commandeering doctrine and the spending power limitations are well-established. The administration will lose these cases, just as it did in the first term.</p>\n\n<p>But that misses the point.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that we're normalizing these confrontations, accepting as routine the deployment of federal force into cities over policy disputes, treating as ordinary the threat to cut funding whenever states decline to cooperate. We're moving from federalism as structure to federalism as discretion, from constitutional limits as binding to constitutional limits as negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>I've sworn an oath to the Constitution enough times to know what it means. It means that powers not granted to the federal government remain with the states. It means that the federal government cannot compel state officers to enforce federal law. It means that spending power has limits. It means that federalism isn't just a theory—it's the architecture that makes self-government possible across a diverse republic.</p>\n\n<p>When that architecture erodes, we don't just lose efficiency or clarity. We lose the structural protection that keeps power from accumulating in a single place, that maintains multiple centers of authority, that preserves space for local democracy and political difference.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether you support sanctuary policies or immigration enforcement. The question is whether you believe the Constitution means what it says about the limits of federal power. The question is whether dual sovereignty still matters, or whether we're willing to trade it for the efficiency of centralized control.</p>\n\n<p>That question, unanswered, is why this matters.</p>\n\n<p>In Union there is Strength.</p>",
