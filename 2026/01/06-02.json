He acted under pressure, without orders, and with full awareness of the personal risk.</p>\n\n<p>Those are precisely the circumstances for which military decorations like the Bronze Star exist.</p>\n\n<p>Valor in defense of the republic is not limited to foreign battlefields.  Courage in a hallway of the Capitol, alone with an angry mob racing toward you, counts.</p>\n\n<p>There’s an empty space on the bookshelf in my office, because the next day, January 7th, I mailed my Bronze Star to Officer Goodman.</p>\n\n<p>He didn’t have a rifle, a squad, or a plan handed down from above.  He had seconds to decide what to do, and he chose to place himself between chaos and constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>That decision likely saved lives.</p>\n\n<p>Courage looks the same whether it happens overseas or in the halls of the Capitol.</p>\n\n<p>We talk a lot about January 6th.  We argue about labels, motives, and narratives.  But some things don’t require argument.</p>\n\n<p>Someone stood between violence and the republic.</p>\n\n<p>He did his duty.</p>\n\n<p>And he deserves to be remembered for it.</p>",
