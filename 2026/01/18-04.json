  "content": "<p>The Constitution begins by placing limits on power before granting it.  Nowhere is that clearer than in the Fourth Amendment, which declares that the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, and that warrants shall issue only upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched.</p>\n\n<p>This is not ornamental language.  It is structural.  It reflects a decision, made deliberately, that the executive branch may not decide for itself when force is justified inside a private home.  That authority is assigned to the judiciary.  The barrier is intentional.  Liberty depends on it.</p>\n\n<p>The founders did not invent this concern.  They inherited it.</p>\n\n<p>In the years leading up to the American Revolution, British authorities relied on writs of assistance, sweeping instruments that allowed customs officials to enter homes, shops, and warehouses without individualized suspicion.  These writs did not name a person.  They did not specify a place.  They did not require evidence of wrongdoing.  They existed to make enforcement efficient.</p>\n\n<p>The colonists recognized them for what they were.  Not merely intrusive, but dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>James Otis’s 1761 argument against the writs electrified Boston.  John Adams later wrote that “then and there the child Independence was born.”  The issue was not contraband.  It was power.  The question was whether the government could decide, on its own authority, when a citizen’s door no longer barred entry.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>A man’s house is his castle; and whilst he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle.</p><cite>— James Otis, 1761</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>That understanding carried forward into the Bill of Rights.  The Fourth Amendment was written precisely to prevent general warrants, administrative shortcuts, and after-the-fact justifications.  It requires particularity because liberty collapses when force is generalized.  It requires a judge because power cannot be trusted to restrain itself.</p>\n\n<p>Against that backdrop, the events in Minnesota matter.</p>\n\n<p>Last weekend, federal agents used a battering ram to force entry into a private home in Minneapolis.  They did so without a judicial warrant authorizing entry.  The document relied upon was an administrative immigration warrant, issued within the executive branch.  No judge reviewed the evidence.  No neutral magistrate authorized the breach of the door.</p>\n\n<p>A federal court later ruled that this violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>That ruling should not surprise anyone familiar with constitutional law.  Administrative warrants may authorize arrest in public spaces.  They do not confer the authority to break into a home.  The home has always been different.  That distinction is not technical.  It is foundational.</p>\n\n<p>Some will argue that the circumstances justify the means.  Others will insist this is about immigration policy, or public safety, or urgency.  Those arguments miss the point.</p>\n\n<p>The Fourth Amendment does not ask whether the government’s goal is popular.  It does not ask whether the target is sympathetic.  It does not ask whether enforcement would be easier without restraint.  It asks only whether the Constitution has been followed.</p>\n\n<p>If executive agencies may unilaterally decide when doors may be broken, the warrant requirement becomes optional.  If administrative paperwork can replace judicial authorization, the separation of powers becomes ceremonial.  If the home is no longer a line, then no line remains.</p>\n\n<p>This is how liberty erodes.  Not through declarations, but through exceptions.  Not through ideology, but through precedent.  Each justification stands alone.  Each step is described as necessary.  Each one makes the next easier.</p>\n\n<p>The founders understood this pattern because they lived under it.</p>\n\n<p>The threshold of the home is not a procedural inconvenience.  It is the point where a free society draws its boundary.  When that boundary is breached without lawful authority, the issue is not enforcement.  It is constitutional order.</p>\n\n<p>Power that does not stop at the door will not stop on its own.</p>\n\n<p>Hold Fast.</p>",
