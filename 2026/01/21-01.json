It is no longer.</p>\n\n<p>In recent weeks, the President has revived and escalated claims over Greenland, a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.  What began years ago as an ill-considered proposal to purchase land has now hardened into rhetoric that openly refuses to rule out coercion, including military force.</p>\n\n<p>That shift matters.  It transforms a diplomatic absurdity into a constitutional and international crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Greenland is not an unclaimed frontier.  It is covered by treaty, protected by alliance, and defended under the collective security guarantees of NATO.  Any armed action against it would not be an isolated adventure.  It would be an attack on an ally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Greenland Matters</strong></p>\n\n<p>Greenland occupies a unique strategic position in the Arctic.  It hosts long-standing U.S. military installations, including early warning and space tracking capabilities essential to North American defense.  Those capabilities exist by agreement, not <em>conquest</em>.  They rest on cooperation with Denmark, not <em>coercion</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing about Greenland’s geography requires its seizure.  The United States already possesses access, basing rights, and freedom of movement through existing treaties.  No capability gap has been identified that could not be addressed through diplomacy or alliance coordination.</p>\n\n<p>What has changed is not the strategic environment.  It is the <em>posture</em> of power.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NATO Is Not Optional</strong></p>\n\n<p>Denmark is a NATO member.  Greenland falls under NATO’s collective defense commitments.  Article 5 does not contain an exception for impatience, ambition, or rhetoric dressed as realism.</p>\n\n<p>European governments have responded accordingly.  In January, multiple NATO allies deployed forces to Greenland for joint exercises and deterrence operations.  The message was unmistakable.  An attack on Greenland would be an attack on NATO itself.</p>\n\n<p>This is not provocation.  It is the alliance functioning exactly as designed.</p>\n\n<p>That reality has not been denied by the administration.  Instead, it has been minimized, deflected, or treated as a negotiable inconvenience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Economic Coercion Is Still Coercion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Military threats have been accompanied by economic pressure.  The administration has announced tariffs targeting multiple European states, explicitly linked to the Greenland dispute.  The implication is clear.  Compliance will be rewarded.  Resistance will be punished.</p>\n\n<p>This tactic is not new.  It is simply being applied to allies rather than adversaries.</p>\n\n<p>The effect has been predictable.  Protests in Greenland and Denmark.  Diplomatic outrage across Europe.  Growing concern that economic tools are being used not to defend trade, but to compel territorial concessions.</p>\n\n<p>That is not statecraft.  It is extortion by policy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Constitution Has Not Been Repealed</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“From the nature of man we may be sure, that those who have power in their hands will not give it up while they can retain it.”</p><cite>— George Mason, <em>Constitutional Convention (1787)</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>Under American law, the President does not possess unilateral authority to wage war against a treaty ally.</p>\n\n<p>Congress retains the power to declare war, fund military operations, and constrain executive action that violates treaty obligations.  Those powers are not theoretical.  They are statutory.</p>\n\n<p>Legal scholars have pointed to existing law that would allow Congress to prohibit military action against Greenland explicitly, without ambiguity.  The authority exists.  What remains uncertain is whether it will be exercised.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution assumes ambition will be checked by ambition.  It does not assume restraint will arise spontaneously.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Test of the Republic</strong></p>\n\n<p>This moment is not about Greenland alone.</p>\n\n<p>It is about whether alliances still bind.  Whether treaties still mean what they say.  Whether the law restrains power when restraint becomes inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>If a President may threaten force against an ally to acquire territory, then NATO becomes conditional.  If Congress declines to act when the boundary is crossed, then constitutional war powers become ceremonial.  If economic coercion replaces diplomacy, then rules give way to leverage.</p>\n\n<p>These are not abstract concerns.  They are precedents being written in real time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where We Are</strong></p>\n\n<p>Greenland has become a mirror.  It reflects a question the republic must answer.</p>\n\n<p>Is power constrained by law, or merely <em>delayed</em> by it.</p>\n\n<p>Alliances survive only so long as they are honored.  Constitutions endure only so long as they are enforced.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“The truth is, that, in our governments, the supreme, absolute, and uncontrollable power remains in the people.”</p><cite>— James Wilson, <em>Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, December 4, 1787</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the boundary.  It will ask not whether it was tested, but why it went unanswered.</p>\n\n<p>Hold Fast</p>",
