  "content": "<p>On Wednesday, FBI agents in ballistic vests entered the Fulton County Election Hub in Georgia with a federal warrant.  They loaded materials into trucks.  They seized records from an election held more than four years ago.  An election that was certified by Republican election officials.  An election that survived hand recounts.  An election whose results were upheld by dozens of courts, including judges appointed by the candidate who lost.</p>\n\n<p>This was not an isolated act.</p>\n\n<p>Four days earlier, federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse and United States citizen, on the streets of Minneapolis.  Hours later, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota's governor demanding access to the state's voter rolls.  She framed it as a condition for restoring order, order disrupted by federal agents her administration deployed.  Minnesota's Secretary of State called it \"an apparent ransom to pay for our state's peace and security.\"</p>\n\n<p>Pretti was the second American citizen killed by federal agents in Minnesota this month.  Renee Good died earlier in January under similar circumstances.  Neither was charged with a crime.  Neither received a trial.  Both were killed in the streets by agents of the federal government, and within days, that same government demanded the state's voter data as the price of peace.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Justice is now suing more than two dozen states for access to voter rolls.  <em>Every one of them is a state Donald Trump lost in 2020.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is the context in which FBI agents arrived in Fulton County.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Record Speaks</strong></p>\n\n<p>The facts of the 2020 election are not in dispute.  Georgia's election was among the most scrutinized in American history.  Biden won by 11,779 votes.  The state conducted a hand recount of nearly five million ballots.  The result held.  Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who supported Trump, certified the outcome.  Multiple audits followed.  No widespread fraud was found.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous courts rejected the legal challenges.  Not on procedural grounds.  On the merits.</p>\n\n<p>In a recorded phone call, the nineteenth attempt by the White House to reach Raffensperger, the losing candidate made his demands explicit.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have.  Because we won the state.  There's nothing wrong with saying, you know, that you've recalculated.  So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do?  We won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this.  And it's going to be very costly in many ways.</p><cite>— Donald Trump, <em>phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger</em>, January 2, 2021</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>Raffensperger refused.  He followed the law instead of the president's instruction.</p>\n\n<p>Two criminal indictments followed years later, one federal, one state, both charging election interference.  The federal case was dismissed after Trump won the 2024 election.  The state case collapsed after the district attorney was disqualified and was dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>Now the federal government he leads has obtained a warrant to seize the materials from that election.</p>\n\n<p>This is not investigation.  This is not oversight.  <em>This is the stage being set.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What Is Being Built</strong></p>\n\n<p>Consider what the federal government has done in January 2026 alone.</p>\n\n<p>Federal agents have killed two unarmed American citizens in a single state.  The Attorney General has demanded that state's voter rolls as ransom for ending the federal occupation.  The Department of Justice has sued dozens of states for voter data, every state the president lost.  And the FBI has raided an election office to seize ballots from the election he lost four years ago, citing fraud claims that courts rejected in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a series of coincidences.  <em>This is construction.</em>  The apparatus taking shape is one of intimidation, data consolidation, and retroactive investigation of elections whose outcomes displease whoever holds power.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\"</p><cite>— Alexander Hamilton, <em>Federalist No. 68</em>, March 12, 1788</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>Hamilton believed the constitutional structure would prevent unfit men from seizing the presidency.  He did not anticipate that an unfit man, having seized it, would use federal law enforcement to investigate his own prior defeat while his agents killed citizens in the streets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Citizens Must Understand</strong></p>\n\n<p>The question is no longer procedural.  The question is whether the federal government is constructing the machinery to control electoral outcomes through force and intimidation.</p>\n\n<p>When federal agents kill American citizens without trial, and the Attorney General demands voter rolls as the price of peace, that is not law enforcement.  <em>That is extortion.</em></p>\n\n<p>When the FBI seizes ballots from an election certified four years ago, at the direction of the candidate who lost that election, that is not investigation.  <em>That is occupation.</em></p>\n\n<p>When the Department of Justice sues every state the president lost for access to voter data, that is not oversight.  <em>That is preparation.</em></p>\n\n<p>Preparation for what?</p>\n\n<p>Ask this: If these actions are permitted in 2026, what will be permitted in 2028?  If the president can deploy federal agents to kill citizens, demand voter data as ransom, and seize ballots from elections he lost, what election can be conducted freely?  What vote can be cast without fear?  What outcome can stand if it displeases the man who commands the FBI?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Framers' Warning</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Founders built the Constitution to prevent exactly this.  They had seen what happened when executive power operated without constraint.  They designed a system of checks precisely because they knew what men with power would do if unchecked.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>If men were angels, no government would be necessary.  If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"</p><cite>— James Madison, <em>Federalist No. 51</em>, February 6, 1788</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>Madison understood that power must be constrained because those who hold it cannot be trusted to constrain themselves.  The events of this month prove him right.  Federal agents are killing citizens.  The Attorney General is demanding voter data under threat.  The FBI is seizing ballots from settled elections.  And the constraints Madison designed are failing.</p>\n\n<p>They are failing because the institutions meant to enforce them have been captured by the man they were meant to constrain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What We Are Witnessing</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is not a constitutional debate.  This is not a question for law reviews and symposiums.  This is happening <em>now</em>, in January 2026, while citizens watch.</p>\n\n<p>Two Americans are dead at the hands of federal agents.  No one has been charged.  No one has been held accountable.  The Attorney General has demanded voter rolls from the state where they died, and called it a path to peace.</p>\n\n<p>The FBI has raided an election office in Georgia to seize ballots from 2020, and called it investigation.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Justice is suing every state the president lost, demanding data on every registered voter, and calling it oversight.</p>\n\n<p>This is not oversight.  This is not investigation.  This is not law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is what it looks like when a government constitutes itself as the arbiter of which elections are legitimate, and backs that claim with federal agents who kill without consequence.</em></p>\n\n<p>The Founders had a word for this.</p>\n\n<p>They called it <em>tyranny</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And they did not respond to tyranny with measured questions about precedent and procedure.  They responded with clarity, with conviction, and with the understanding that some things cannot be tolerated by free people.</p>\n\n<p>The test is not whether these actions are defensible in court.  The test is whether Americans will accept a government that kills its citizens, demands their voter data as ransom, and sends armed agents to seize the ballots of elections it lost.</p>\n\n<p>If we accept that, we have accepted that we are no longer citizens.</p>\n\n<p><em>We are subjects.</em></p>",
