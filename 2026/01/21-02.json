  "content": "<p>The First Amendment was not written to protect polite agreement. It was written to protect resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Not resistance of arms, but resistance of words. Not secrecy, but open dissent. Not whispers, but public warning spoken plainly in daylight.</p>\n\n<p>When federal prosecutors are turned against those engaged in protected speech, the Constitution is not being enforced. It is being inverted.</p>\n\n<p>The danger does not begin when a conviction is secured. It begins when the machinery of prosecution is aimed at speech itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speech as a Boundary, Not a Threat</strong></p>\n\n<p>In a free republic, disagreement with the executive is not sabotage. Criticism of enforcement is not obstruction. Calling for legality is not interference.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders understood this distinction intimately. They had lived under a system where law was used as a pretext to punish dissent, where prosecutions were less about justice than submission.</p>\n\n<p>James Otis warned in 1761, while opposing writs of assistance that empowered officials to search without restraint,</p>\n\n<blockquote>“It is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>Otis was not speaking abstractly. He was describing the precise moment when law ceases to be a shield and becomes a weapon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Prosecutor’s Power</strong></p>\n\n<p>Prosecutors do not merely enforce law. They define its boundaries in practice.</p>\n\n<p>A subpoena is not neutral when its target is speech. An investigation is not passive when its purpose is to chill expression. The threat alone alters behavior.</p>\n\n<p>When speech is recast as interference, and dissent is framed as defiance, the prosecutor becomes a political actor whether intended or not.</p>\n\n<p>This was not lost on the early American jurists.</p>\n\n<p>St. George Tucker, writing in 1803 on the Constitution’s protections, observed,</p>\n\n<blockquote>“The people of America have not thought proper to suffer the freedom of speech, and of the press, to rest upon such an uncertain foundation, as the will and pleasure of the government.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tucker understood that the danger lies not in the final verdict, but in the submission required to avoid prosecution altogether.</p>\n\n<p>Not later. Not after conviction. Already.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From Accountability to Intimidation</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a lawful role for federal prosecutors. It is narrow, defined, and essential.</p>\n\n<p>But when prosecutors are deployed in response to criticism rather than crime, the line has been crossed. The state ceases to ask whether the law was broken and instead demands whether obedience was sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>This inversion transforms constitutional accountability into a test of loyalty.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders did not design a system where speech must first be approved by those in power to be safe. They designed one where power must withstand scrutiny or yield.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why This Matters Now</strong></p>\n\n<p>History does not mark the moment liberty disappears with a single stroke. It erodes through precedent. Through normalization. Through the quiet acceptance that investigations are simply the price of speaking too loudly.</p>\n\n<p>Every investigation of protected speech teaches a lesson. Not just to the target, but to everyone watching.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson is not about law. It is about risk.</p>\n\n<p>And risk is the enemy of free speech.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The First Amendment Is Not Conditional</strong></p>\n\n<p>The First Amendment does not protect speech only when it is convenient. It does not yield to executive irritation. It does not retreat because enforcement finds criticism uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>It stands precisely where power wishes it would not.</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether prosecutors are acting within procedure. It is whether procedure is being used to accomplish what law forbids.</p>\n\n<p>The Founders anticipated this danger. They named it. They warned against it. They wrote a Constitution to prevent it.</p>\n\n<p>That Constitution still speaks.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it is heard depends on whether we remember what it was written to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Hold Fast</p>",
